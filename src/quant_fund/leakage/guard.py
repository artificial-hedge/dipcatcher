"""Runtime IO guard — interposition on raw reads inside proven windows
(WAVE2.md §6).

Wave 1's watchdog covers reads that go THROUGH ``PitVault.asof``; it cannot
see strategy code that bypasses the vault entirely with a raw
``pl.read_parquet`` / ``pd.read_parquet`` / ``open()`` — the "rogue second
vault" class. ``install_io_guard`` closes that class at the call-site level
by monkey-interposing those three entry points for the duration of a proven
run.

Activation rule (binding): the guard intercepts ONLY while a proven decision
window is active, i.e. ``proofcore.run_context.current_decision_time() is not
None``. That accessor falls back to the R2 thread-visible registry, so reads
from bare ``threading.Thread`` workers (which carry no contextvars context)
are covered too. Outside a window — including everywhere outside proven runs —
the wrappers are a single ``is None`` check away from the original function:
zero interception, no behavior change.

Modes:

- ``"enforce"`` (proven-runner default): a raw read of a non-allowlisted
  path inside an active window raises :class:`LeakageError`. A vault-mapped
  path is never read raw — it is routed through the mapped vault's
  ``asof(name, decision_time)`` so the read lands in the recorder/watchdog.
- ``"redirect"``: vault-mapped paths route through ``vault.asof``; unknown
  paths warn (``IOGuardWarning``), are recorded, and proceed.
- ``"audit"``: record everything, raise nothing, redirect nothing.

The guard is re-entrant (nested ``install_io_guard`` yields the already
installed guard; interposition is removed only when the outermost exit runs)
and thread-safe (module lock around install/teardown; per-guard lock around
the record log). Interposition is always fully removed on exit, including on
exceptions.

Layering (DESIGN.md §1.3): imports ``leakage.watchdog`` (same package) and
``proofcore.run_context`` (layer 1) only; polars/pandas are imported lazily
at install time so importing this module stays cheap and side-effect free.
