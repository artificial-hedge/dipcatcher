"""Leakage Hunter rule registry (LH001..LH014) and path allowlists.

RULE_REGISTRY is the ONLY source of rule metadata (DESIGN.md §6.1). Rule IDs
are permanent; new rules append with new IDs. Allowlists are per-rule
frozensets of path globs; every entry carries a comment citing why the
existing site is legitimate (or which audit finding / follow-up owns it).
LH001 also has a function-scoped allowlist: the file stays scanned, and
only the named function is exempt.

Residual ceiling (ADVERSARIAL §1a, pinned by the documented-negative fixtures
in tests/leakage_fixtures/adv_*.py): numpy/pandas index arithmetic, dict
lookups at ``dates[i+1]``, lone numbers beyond the proximity window, manual
Sharpe algebra without a ``sharpe_ratio`` call, and cross-file/multi-level
helper indirection remain uncaught. The pack is a tripwire; the runtime
watchdog + proof layer are the barrier.
