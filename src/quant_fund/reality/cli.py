"""``quant reality`` sub-typer — reality-filter CLI (PROOFCORE W4 §7.9).

Commands operate on a trial-ledger JSONL file (one
``proofcore.contracts.TrialLedgerRow`` per line; the JSONL export format of
the provenance DB per DESIGN.md §14.4). Prints verdicts and diagnostics only
— per the AGENTS.md honesty contract no Sharpe/P&L/NAV is headlined.

``preflight`` classifies the gate inputs. ``data/metadata/proofcore.duckdb``
is not in the repository at HEAD or on main (``data/metadata/**`` is
gitignored), so a checkout has no database file and ``quant proofcore
export`` would create an empty DB and write 0 trial rows. That absence is
an explicit skip (exit 3). An empty export of a database that does exist
is the same skip. ``trial-report`` and ``ledger-gate`` stay fail-closed
on an empty ledger file.

Mounting into the top-level ``quant`` app is owned by W5 (cli glue);
this module only defines the sub-typer.
