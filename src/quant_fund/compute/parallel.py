"""Order-preserving process maps for embarrassingly parallel research sweeps.

Each task receives ``derive_seed(base_seed, index)``. The seed depends only
on the base and the task index, not on which worker runs it and not on
completion order. Callers that draw random numbers must use that seed.
Callers whose existing math is deterministic ignore it so published numbers
stay on the original formula.

Linux uses ``fork`` so workers inherit the already-imported parent. A pool
that cannot start falls back to the calling process; task exceptions still
propagate. Below ``min_items`` the map stays inline.
