"""Crown-jewel byte pins for the gate-defining files.

The epoch chains cover ``receipts/``, ``verifier/``, ``quality/`` and
``.github/workflows/*.yml`` — but the files that *define* the gates live at
repo root: lint/type/test config, the dependency lock, the Makefile that
names the checks, the pre-commit hooks, the secret-scan allowlist, and
``AGENTS.md`` — the honesty contract itself. A silent edit there weakens
every check downstream of it.

``quality/crown_jewels.json`` pins ``relpath -> sha256`` for exactly
``DEFAULT_JEWELS``. The coverage set is code-defined on purpose: removing a
pin entry fails ``jewel_unpinned``, an entry outside the set fails
``jewel_unexpected`` — the pin cannot quietly shrink or grow. A tampered or
deleted file fails ``jewel_mutated`` / ``jewel_missing``; a pinned path that
is a symlink fails ``jewel_symlink`` (content substitution).

The pin file is itself a member of the ``quality/*.json`` epoch chain, so
its bytes are chain-stamped; the recursion bottoms out at git review of the
pin/epoch diff — the documented trust boundary, same as the epoch head pin.
