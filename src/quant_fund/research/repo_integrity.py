"""Repo integrity capstone: one sealed attestation over the whole evidence
integrity substrate.

The pieces each gate one surface — ``crown_jewels`` byte-pins the gate-defining
files, ``corpus_epoch`` chains the evidence corpora, ``check_epoch_chain``
verifies them. ``verify_repo`` composes them into a single verdict and seals it
as a ``repo_integrity.v1`` receipt: a point-in-time proof that the repo's
evidence corpus and the config that gates it were all intact *at the same
instant*.

The committed attestation is itself a ``quality/`` chain member, so a stale
attestation can't be silently edited — the next epoch stamp records the drift.

Provenance evidence only; never a market or P&L claim.
