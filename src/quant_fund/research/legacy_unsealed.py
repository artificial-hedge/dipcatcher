"""Hash-pinned allowlists of byte-exact legacy receipts.

Every committed ``receipts/*.json`` must seal-verify. ``KNOWN_UNSEALED``
previously exempted the seven pre-seal-era artifacts; those migrated to
``receipts/legacy-unsealed/`` (a quarantined subdir — see
``utils.receipt.QUARANTINED_SUBDIRS``), so the map is
empty — it must stay empty: a new unsealed receipt in ``receipts/`` fails.

``KNOWN_CONTRACT_LEGACY`` pins sealed receipts written by drill scripts
before their kind's deep contract existed — they pass the seal check but
fail contract re-derivation on shape alone. Exempt ONLY for the exact
error listed; any other failure still fails.

Shrink-only: removing an entry is always safe; adding one is a defect
(commit the new receipt sealed and contract-conformant instead).
Shared by the committed-receipts test ratchet and ``suite-health --strict``.
