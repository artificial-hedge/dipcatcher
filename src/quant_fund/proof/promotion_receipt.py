"""Fail-closed composition of immutable promotion receipts (``promotion_receipt.v1``).

A promotion receipt is one composed, immutable record binding:

- artifact identity — payload hash, manifest hash, artifact class, feature
  identity, label/horizon identity and full **dataset identity** (required;
  missing or unverified dataset identity blocks promotion),
- the ``evidence_report.v1`` bytes by hash (with its sidecar),
- the ``promotion.v1`` decision, its input metrics and every gate result,
- the approving identity.

Composition is fail-closed: every precondition raises
:class:`PromotionCompositionError` — approved decision only
(``promotion_is_approved``), non-synthetic evidence only, evidence report
complete and hash-bound, all required gate results present and passing, an
honest named approver with a timestamped decision, and a verified artifact
manifest. The receipt is written exactly once (exclusive create) with a
``.sha256`` sidecar and is never rewritten.

Verification is an independent implementation in
:mod:`quant_fund.research.verify` (``verify-research``): composition-side
gating and verification-side checking share no code, so a bug in one cannot
vouch for the other.
