"""Flash-context refresh: re-check an entry's sources instead of guessing.

Refreshing never rewrites the finding itself — it re-fetches each recorded
source and records what happened (reachable / unreachable / changed status),
stamping ``refreshed_at`` and a plain-language ``refresh_note``. When a source
is gone, the entry is marked stale so retrieval demotes it; the finding text
keeps its provenance history. A ``fetch_fn`` injection point keeps this
testable offline (the default lazily imports the web-research fetcher).
