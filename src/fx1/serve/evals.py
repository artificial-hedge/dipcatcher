"""fx-1 eval submissions — the seeded suite battery over the wire.

Every eval the harness ships takes a ``ModelFn``; a resolved serving
backend *is* one. This module is the bridge between them:

- ``EVAL_SUITES`` — lazily-loaded registry (suite name -> runner) so the
  eval import chain never loads for a server that only serves
  completions. ``accepts_judge`` marks the suites that take a grader
  ``ModelFn`` (capability and the external-bench adapter).
- ``EvalRecord`` — the bounded-store record a submission produces:
  suite/seed/backend + the serialized report, sealed on export as
  ``fx1_eval_record.v1``.
- ``EvalStore`` — LRU of records with an Idempotency-Key index (the
  same contract ``_JobStore`` gives run jobs).
- ``metered_model`` — wraps the resolved backend so every model call
  inside an eval lands on the metrics ledger under
  ``eval:{suite}:{backend}`` — never silent.
- ``run_eval_record`` — the worker: drive the runner, serialize the
  report fail-closed, stamp finish. Called from the jobs executor under
  the shared inflight/drain contract.

Evals always run under the decode pin ``{"temperature": 0.0}`` —
recorded on the record so a sealed eval receipt states the exact decode
config the evidence was produced under.
