"""dipcatcher as the fx-1 harness.

The relationship, inverted: **fx-1 is the model; dipcatcher is the harness
that builds, evaluates, and verifies it.** This module is the typed bridge —
every lab capability fx-1 is allowed to touch is registered here as a
:class:`HarnessCommand` and executed through an injectable runner, so tests
never spawn real lab processes and fx-1 can never reach an unregistered
command.

Harness roles:
- *Data engine* — ingest/collect/features/labels feed ``fx1.data``.
- *Evaluation* — benches and books score fx-1's domain competence;
  ``fx1.eval`` scores its behavior.
- *Verification* — doctor / verify-research / validate / monitor gate every
  artifact the model is trained on or claims about.
- *Model training* — the lab's own train/optimize/paper surfaces, usable as
  curriculum and tool-use trace sources for fx-1.
