"""Hypothesis → config → bench → result trace generation.

The highest-value fx-1 training signal is the full research loop: a stated
hypothesis, the config diff that tests it, the harness bench that runs it,
and the gate decision that results. Traces are recorded as structured
objects; only gate-resolved traces (pass *or* fail) are admissible — a trace
with no verdict teaches nothing verifiable.
