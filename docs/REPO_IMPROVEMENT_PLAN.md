# Repository improvement sequence

The goal is reviewable evidence of economic value and reliable operation.
Return improvement must be measured on the target market after costs.

| Order | Work | Status and acceptance evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Real-data benchmark | Executed against the tracked 424-name snapshot with sealed validation and previously inspected test scores. Zero forecast won validation MSE; ridge's small test advantage has no economic interpretation. See [REAL_DATA_BENCHMARK.md](REAL_DATA_BENCHMARK.md) and the Phase 1 evidence report. |
| 2 | Net-return tournament | Executed the frozen equal-weight, momentum-20 and reversal-1 slate with full ledgers and both impact scenarios. Validation selected momentum-20, which underperformed equal weight on the inspected test; the economic evidence gate is false. See [NET_RETURN_TOURNAMENT.md](NET_RETURN_TOURNAMENT.md) and the Phase 1 evidence report. |
| 3 | Cost-aware construction | The matched validation run retained both failed cost-aware candidates: CLARABEL returned `optimal_inaccurate`. No candidate was selected, so there is no cost-aware test or uplift estimate. Constraints remain fail-closed. See [COST_AWARE_CONSTRUCTION.md](COST_AWARE_CONSTRUCTION.md) and the Phase 1 evidence report. |
| 4 | Forward shadow record | Local simulated protocols implemented: a frozen research candidate and benchmark with atomic settlement journal, plus a bounded paired paper adapter and pre-collection power plan. No external freeze or prospective market decision has been collected. Source verification and an independently timestamped complete-universe feed remain required. See [FORWARD_SHADOW_RECORD.md](FORWARD_SHADOW_RECORD.md), [PAPER_SHADOW.md](PAPER_SHADOW.md), and [FORWARD_SHADOW_POWER.md](FORWARD_SHADOW_POWER.md). |
| 5 | Performance and operations | Executed. Bottlenecks profiled and optimized bit-identically (see [PERF.md](PERF.md) hot paths and [PERF_SWEEP.md](PERF_SWEEP.md) event-loop cProfile with `scripts/_perf_sweep.py` / `_perf_identity.py` replays). Representative workload budgets are pinned as calibration-normalized benchmarks in `tests/perf/` with the committed `baselines/baseline.json` and enforced in CI by `check_regression.py` (50% threshold, `--ci` mode). Reference/fast-path equivalence is pinned by `tests/unit/test_perf_equivalence.py`. Recovery and observability are covered by the serve `observe_audit`/`perf_audit`/`drain_audit` lanes (liveness-readiness split, Prometheus exposition, drain latch, journaled restart durability) and [AUDIT_OBSERVABILITY.md](AUDIT_OBSERVABILITY.md) / [OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md](OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md). |

The existing vendor pool discloses survivorship bias and already has results
for the 2025 holdout. It can support retrospective diagnostics. Stronger
evidence requires verified data availability/adjustments and a fresh externally
timestamped forward period. A passing forecast benchmark alone cannot promote
a strategy or authorize live execution.

The sealed Phase 1 report is `data/metadata/research/phase1_20260925.md`;
`data/metadata/research/phase1_evidence_index.json` links its complete and
blocked runs to the frozen configs and source commit. Use
`dipcatcher verify-research data/metadata/research/phase1_evidence_index.json`
in a checkout containing the tracked snapshot and published ledgers.
