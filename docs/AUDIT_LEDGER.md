# Audit Ledger

Per-directory evidence for `quality/audit_coverage.json`. "Audited" means every
module was read and its risk-bearing paths verified against the honesty
contract: strict causality (no feature reads data after the decision origin),
fail-closed validation (degenerate input raises or returns a labeled NaN),
honest labeling (SYNTHETIC forced, forbidden metrics gated), and durable writes
(atomic, sealed where they are evidence).

| `cli/` | All 15 modules: argv-list subprocess only, no shell, config-error UX | #205 doctor UX |
| `compute/` | Per-task seed derivation (murmur-finalize mix) so process_map result order = item order; serial fallback on pool failure; task exceptions propagate | — |

## Deferred findings (audited, fix pending)

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| `benches/common.py` split helpers (`_holdout`/`_triple_split`/`_gaussian_interval_split`) — chronological row cuts with no boundary label purge | found via #341's `docs/AUDIT_RESEARCH.md`; **fixed on #342** — splits now return boolean row masks cut at unique-date boundaries via `purge_mask` on both edges (train↔cal and cal↔test), callers fail closed on emptied sides, OnlineCRC warms only on kept rows |

## fx1 (the gated product — `quality/audit_coverage_fx1.json`)

Parallel manifest, same schema + ratchet tests: 115/116 modules `audited`
(`__init__.py` waived as package surface). Directory pins: eval 28, forecast
14, bench 5, serve 11, data 20, train 13; root modules audited individually.

| Area | Verified | Findings → fix |
|---|---|---|
| `honesty.py` + `data/` | Child audit — regex evasions, corpus screening, contamination floor, vacuous honesty gate | #321 |
| `eval/` | Deterministic seeded banks, contract-validated prompts, unparseable answers counted (never propagated), degenerate forecasts fail closed NaN, `passed` requires finite ECE AND finite \|Z\| | — |
| `serve/` | HMAC-env signing (never hardcoded), fail-closed compare_digest verify, structural TEE + zkML manifests with honest crypto delegation; consumption lanes: BYOK OpenAI-compat backend (fail-closed creds, temp-0 wire), harness HTTP API (auth/loopback-only, body cap, batch + SSE stream routes gated before bytes leave), `sdk.py` in-process twin, `parity_audit` — SDK↔API byte-identical content/envelope/errors/verifier over one injected backend | #839 |
| `bench/` + `forecast/` | `bench/dip.py` verified: causal dip detection (fires below running peak only), recovery windows bounded at data end → `None` never imputed, out-of-range probabilities raise, `assert_bench_output_honest` mirrors the forbidden-token contract inside the bench itself; `forecast/evaluate.py`: `assert_no_label_overlap` per fold, walk-forward fails closed on empty folds, finite-masked metrics; `runner.py` decision-time machinery (`_at_decision`, late-release flag) | — |
| `train/` + root modules | `train/pipeline.py`: hard stage gates, mandatory pre-training honesty gate (`eval_base` blocks TRAIN when `honesty_gate_passed` is false), corpus dedup/decontamination vs eval prompts, frozen split manifest; `train/receipts.py`: receipt pins SHA-256 of config/corpus/split/eval_base + git rev + dirty flag + env fingerprint with forced `live_pnl_claim=False`/`research_only=True`; `default_trainer` fails closed (no local GPU trainer — injectable); `reward.py`: executable honesty-contract reward (forbidden-headline/live-claim/synthetic-unlabeled → low score); `hypotheses.py`: only gate-resolved traces admissible; `mrm.py`: dossier sections cite artifact hashes, missing artifact fails closed | — |
| wave-3 depth pass — all 66 files | Full re-verification of every module against fail-closed/no-silent-pass/no-forbidden-metric contracts; evidence in `docs/AUDIT_FX1_WAVE3.md` | 26 defects fixed, incl. `eval_prompt_surface` bare-global `NameError` + user-only role filter, windowed near-dup dedup (`[-500:]` evasion), boundary-ambiguous split hashing, vacuous frozen-split/contamination-audit passes, truthy non-bool `research_only`/`live_pnl_claim` evasion, unverified `verify_ok` traces, free-form ledger hashes, 1500-char notebook truncation, non-date `as_of` PIT keys, honesty-gate reporting-verb phrasing, trace-score substring evasion, dip recovery off-by-one, silent out-of-universe forecast drops, normalized-key bench evasion, `eval_base` hash taken on faith (now re-verified vs receipt), eval gate checking only the top flag, non-atomic evidence writes across mrm/bench/train, `--config` containment bypass, null→`"None"` completion coercion |

## Rules

- A directory may only move `partial → audited` when every module has a row of
  evidence here or in a linked audit doc (`AUDIT_P6*.md`, child audit tables).
- `test_audited_dirs_pin_file_count` fails the build if an audited dir gains or
  loses a module without a manifest update.
- `AUDITED_FLOOR` ratchets only upward.
