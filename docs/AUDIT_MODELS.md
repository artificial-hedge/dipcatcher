# Models audit — `src/quant_fund/models/`

Deep correctness audit of the estimator/model catalog (141 modules, ~28k
LOC). Contract under test: fail-closed causality and honesty — look-ahead,
silent NaN propagation, fabrications, or non-contract error handling are
defects.

Method: (a) estimator-family formula checks against docstring/cited papers;
(b) causality — index math touching future rows, rolling/expanding windows
including the prediction row, statistics fit on full sample; (c) fail-closed —
degenerate inputs (constant series, NaN/inf, empty, wrong shape) must raise or
return labeled NaN, never silently produce numbers; (d) numerical
overflow/underflow paths (exp/log space, covariance inversions, optimizer
invalid-region penalties). Every fixed defect has a regression test in
`tests/unit/models/test_models_audit.py`.

Legend: **FIXED** — defect found, patched, regression-tested. **CLEAN** —
audited paths verified (guards, index math, formula spot-check); no defect.
**DEFERRED** — coverage shallow; deeper verification pending or fix deferred.

## Fixed defects

| Module | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ar_estimation | FIXED | `levinson_durbin` floored `sigma2` at 1e-12 when the autocovariance sequence was not positive-definite (`|k|>=1`); now raises ValueError. |
| arma | FIXED | `arma_css` accepted a BFGS result at the 1e14 non-finite penalty as an optimum; now raises. |
| archimedean_extra | FIXED | `joe_fit` accepted `minimize_scalar` landing on the 1e12 penalty (returned theta=bound, loglik=-1e12); now raises. |
| caviar | FIXED | multi-start loop could keep `res.fun == 1e12` (invalid-parameter penalty) as best, then `_q_path` returned None into an `assert`; penalty now excluded, raises on all-fail. |
| cs_papers | DEFERRED | Real boundary-overlap: `MSFECombinationRanker.fit` nested split `groups[:n_train]`/`groups[n_train:]` has no embargo; with forward labels (`future_*_N`, N>1) the last ~N train date-groups' label windows straddle the hold groups, contaminating inner MSFE weights. Fix deferred — central purge sweep in progress. |
| dcc | FIXED | stage-2 Nelder-Mead accepted the 1e12 penalty when `a+b < 0.999`; now raises. |
| diffusion_index | FIXED | h-step forecast evaluated the design row at `t = T-1-h` (last fitted row) instead of the true origin `t = T-1`; forecast was stale by h steps. |
| duration | FIXED | `_nll_weibull` missed the `(gamma-1)*ln(1/psi)` term in the eps->x density transform; psi coefficient was -1 instead of -gamma, biasing WACD fits for gamma != 1. |
| dynamic_panel | FIXED | `ar2_coef` computed the lag-1 correlation of differenced residuals; the Arellano-Bond AR(2) test needs lag-2. |
| factor_models | FIXED | `bai_ng_factors` on a zero-variance panel divided by zero and silently returned `r_max-1`; now raises. `double_sorted_factors` binned cells via ordinal `argsort`∘`argsort` ranks — tie groups straddling a cell boundary split by storage order (output not permutation-invariant); now bins via `midrank` so each tie group stays in one cell. |
| fgls_ar1 | FIXED | `_rho_from_resid` could return `|rho| >= 1` (denominator over lagged-only terms), making the Prais-Winsten transform `sqrt(1-rho^2)` invalid; now raises. |
| filters | FIXED | `ravn_uhlig_lambda` docstring stated `1600*(4/ppy)^4` (inverted); code correctly computes `1600*(ppy/4)^4`. Docstring corrected. |
| garch_ext | FIXED | `fit_figarch`/`fit_aparch` accepted a 1e12 penalty as `best.fun`; now raises. |
| garch_midas | FIXED | `garch_midas_fit` checked only finiteness of `res.fun`; a 1e12 penalty passed and garbage theta_hat was returned. Now raises. |
| gas | FIXED | `gas_vol_forecast` always applied the `inv_sqrt` update `s/sqrt(info)`; `scaling="unit"` fits were forecast with the wrong recursion. `gas_vol_fit` now returns `scaling` and the forecast honors it. |
| gmm_est | FIXED | both GMM steps accepted `res.fun == 1e14` penalty objectives; now raise. |
| kernel | FIXED | `fit_gp_regression` hyperparameter optimization accepted a 1e12 penalty (`np.isfinite` only); now falls back to defaults like a failed fit. |
| long_memory | FIXED | `local_whittle`/`whittle_arfima` returned `d` from an arbitrary bound point when every evaluation hit the 1e12 penalty; now raise. |
| nonlinear_filters | FIXED | `particle_filter` reset `w = exp(lw)` each step, discarding previous importance weights between resampling events; also corrected the marginal-likelihood increment to `log(sum w_prev * exp(lw))`. |
| nowcasting | FIXED | `fit_midas` with `ar_lag=False`: `yl[0]` is NaN, so `c*yl` poisoned every SSE evaluation to 1e12 — the optimizer never actually optimized and silently returned seed params. Also added the penalty guard on `best.fun`. |
| realized_garch | FIXED | a Nelder-Mead/L-BFGS-B result at the 1e12 penalty passed the success/finiteness check; now rejected (returns None, fail-closed). |
| skew_t | FIXED | `skew_t_fit` had no post-fit check; a 1e12 penalty produced garbage `nu/lam/mu/sigma` and `loglik=-1e12`; now raises. |
| state_space | FIXED | `ou_mle` silently clipped `phi` to `[1e-6, 0.999999]`, fabricating a finite mean-reversion speed on non-stationary series; phi outside (0,1) now raises. |
| tail | FIXED | `ScaledHistoricalTail.predict_var_es` on an unfitted model returned zeros (`0*scale`); `DrawdownClassifier.predict_proba` unfitted returned 0.05 for every row. Both now raise RuntimeError. |
| term_structure | FIXED | `svensson_fit` accepted the 1e12 penalty from `ssr_of` (invalid lambda region); now raises. |
| var_coint | FIXED | four defects: (1) `engle_granger` checked y but not x finiteness — NaN x silently propagated through lstsq; (2) `johansen_test` CVs were indexed by `r` instead of `n-r`, over-rejecting r=0 (used the 1-dim CV 3.76 instead of the n-dim entry); (3) `rank_trace`/`rank_max` counted non-rejections instead of the first non-rejected r (Johansen sequential rank); (4) `vecm_fit` reshaped `bf[rank:]` as `(n, p-1, n).transpose(1,0,2)`, scrambling lag blocks — corrected to `(p-1, n, n).transpose(0,2,1)`. |
