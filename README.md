## Overview

**dipcatcher** is receipt-bound quant research on US equities and crypto for a
small Alpaca account. It is research and simulated paper trading only — there
is no live broker connectivity anywhere in this tree, and nothing in this
document authorizes, promises, or implies otherwise.

The dip question, in `fx1.bench.dip` and
`receipts/legacy-unsealed/dip_bench_crypto_1d_20260925.json`, is the probability that a
drawdown recovers within 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. That committed receipt scores
an in-sample climatology baseline on 11 historical crypto series. Disclaimer
from the file:
The distribution name on PyPI-style metadata is `fx-1`; the two console
entry points installed by this project are `dipcatcher` (the research
harness, formerly and internally called "dipcatcher") and `fx1` (the
model-facing corpus/eval/training-manifest tooling). Both live in one
checkout, at version `0.4.0` (`fx1.__version__`), and both are governed by
the same receipt-and-verification discipline described throughout this
document.

Two words matter more than any other in this repository: **honest** and
**sealed**. Every research claim is expected to resolve to a committed,
hash-sealed receipt under [`receipts/`](receipts/) that a verifier can
recompute byte-for-byte; every headline metric is expected to be a proper
score (pinball loss, CRPS, PIT calibration, QLIKE, Brier, ECE, the Kupiec
test, HMM likelihood) rather than a P&L number. That is not a marketing
choice — it is enforced in code (`quant_fund.research.catalog.registry`,
mirrored by `fx1.honesty`) and re-validated by
[`tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py`](tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py)
so the two halves of the project cannot drift apart.

This README is intentionally long. It is meant to be read once end-to-end
and then used as a reference. Large, auto-generated, or exhaustively
enumerated sections are folded into `<details>` blocks so the document stays
navigable; nothing folded is hidden on purpose, it is just deep enough that
most readers will want to expand it only when they need it.

## Read this first

This section exists because the rest of the document contains diagrams,
tables, numbers, and receipts, and it is easy for numbers to be
misread as promises. They are not promises. Please hold the following in
mind for everything that follows:

- **This is research and simulated software.** Every figure in this README
  that looks like a trading result — win rates, recovery probabilities,
  latency numbers, NAV comparisons — comes from a committed receipt under
  [`receipts/`](receipts/) or [`docs/evidence/index.md`](docs/evidence/index.md),
  each of which is labeled `research_only: true` and, where relevant,
  `live_pnl_claim: false`. None of it is live trading performance, because
  there is no live trading in this repository.
- **Nothing here is investment advice.** Nothing in this repository, this
  README included, is an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to buy or
  sell any security, token, or derivative. Past backtested or simulated
  behavior is not indicative of future results, live or otherwise.
- **This code is proprietary, not open source.** The presence of a public
  GitHub URL does not grant a license to use, copy, modify, fork, or
  redistribute this repository. See [License](#license) and the full text at
  [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). If you are reading this and you are not the owner or
  someone the owner has authorized in writing, your permitted action is to
  read — nothing more.
- **Forbidden headline metrics are enforced, not just promised.**
  `FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS` in
  [`src/quant_fund/research/catalog/registry.py`](src/quant_fund/research/catalog/registry.py)
  — `sharpe`, `sortino`, `calmar`, `pnl`, `nav` — may never appear as a
  headline research key. `fx1.honesty.FORBIDDEN_HEADLINE_TOKENS` mirrors the
  same list for the model side, and a dedicated test
  (`tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py`) fails the build if the two lists
  drift apart. Where NAV appears below (for example in the qlib parity
  section), it is used strictly as a **numerical-agreement / correctness**
  check between two independently computed simulators, never as a return or
  performance figure.
- **Synthetic data is always labeled.** Default research and paper configs
  set `data.source: synthetic`; the CLI prints the literal string
  `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`, and a CI smoke test fails if that label silently
  changes. If a chart, table, or receipt below is built on synthetic data,
  it says so.
- **Read [`docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md`](docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md)
  for the unabridged version of this disclaimer.** It lists, control by
  control, exactly what is implemented, what is simulated, and what remains
  an open gap before any live claim could even be considered — including the
  five minimum evidence conditions reproduced in
  [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness) below.

## Why dipcatcher exists

Most public "quant" repositories on GitHub either (a) show a backtest with a
beautiful equity curve and no way to check whether it leaked the future into
the past, or (b) show a wall of code with no evidence trail connecting a
claim to a reproducible artifact. dipcatcher was built to refuse both
failure modes at once, using three linked ideas:

1. **Point-in-time discipline is a data-layer property, not a modeling
   afterthought.** Every feature has an `available_time`; a feature is
   invisible to a decision made before its data existed. This is enforced in
   `quant_fund.pit` and re-audited by a dedicated leakage-hunter scan
   (`make leakage-scan`), not merely assumed by convention.
2. **A result that cannot be independently recomputed is not a result.**
   Every phase-1 benchmark, tournament, and paper-promotion artifact carries
   `receipt_sha256` — the SHA-256 of its own other fields — plus
   `inputs_sha256`, `script_sha256`, and (where relevant) `bar_files_sha256`.
   `dipcatcher verify-research` / `verify-receipt` / `verify-all` recompute
   those hashes and refuse to pass a tampered or incomplete artifact. See
   [Receipt lifecycle](#receipt-lifecycle) for the full state machine.
3. **A negative result is still a result, and it stays in the tree.**
   Tournaments that fail their frozen slate are sealed as **verified
   blocked** — `valid: true`, `state: "blocked"` — rather than deleted or
   quietly rerun until something looks better. See
   [Evidence and sealed receipts](#evidence-and-sealed-receipts).

- **Sealed receipts.** Phase-1 benchmark and tournament files carry
  `receipt_sha256`, the SHA-256 of the other fields.
  `dipcatcher verify-research` recomputes it and exits nonzero on a mismatch
  (`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`). Paper promotion receipts use the same
  seal. Files under `receipts/` record the input and script hashes the result
  claims (`inputs_sha256`, `script_sha256`, `bar_files_sha256`, and related
  fields).
- **Fail-closed verification.** An invalid notebook, a missing metric, or a
  non-finite metric does not promote. SYNTHETIC evidence marked as live fails
  the gate in `quant_fund.validation.gates`. `dipcatcher doctor` exits nonzero
  until a data manifest and a valid research receipt are both present.
- **Published negative results.**
  `receipts/legacy-unsealed/adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json` records
  `selected_band: null` and `eligible: false` on every candidate.
  `receipts/legacy-unsealed/basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json` records
  `development_eligible: false`. A sealed blocked tournament stays a
  reviewable failure (`valid: true`, `state: "blocked"`) with no test receipt
  and no selected candidate (`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`).
- **qlib parity receipt.** `receipts/legacy-unsealed/incumbent_bench_qlib.json` is one matched
  workload against qlib 0.9.7 on Binance daily bars (`BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`,
  `SOLUSDT`), with `research_only: true` and `live_pnl_claim: false`. Copied
  from that file, `nav_max_rel_diff` is `1.0290734772388363e-07`. Disclaimer,
  copied verbatim: "Single matched workload vs qlib 0.9.x on real Binance
  daily bars. Correctness is NAV parity; latency is single-process wall time.
  Not a claim of superiority across all product dimensions."
- **Synthetic stays labeled.** Default research and paper configs set
  `data.source: synthetic`. The CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC` and the
  word `SYNTHETIC`. The CI smoke fails if that notebook's `data_source` is
  anything else.
`fx-1` (the model line, [described below](#fx-1)) exists because the same
discipline that makes the research harness auditable also makes it a
uniquely well-labeled training corpus: every receipt that passes the ship
gate becomes a positive example, and every receipt that fails becomes a
negative one, so the model that eventually gets trained on this corpus
inherits the harness's honesty contract rather than learning to imitate
whatever looks impressive.

## Visual tour

Every diagram in this section is either generated directly from the source
tree by [`scripts/gen_arch_diagrams.py`](scripts/gen_arch_diagrams.py) (data
flow, paper/shadow sequence, module dependencies — checked for drift by the
`atlas` CI workflow against
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE_ATLAS.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_ATLAS.md)) or derived
directly from committed receipts and `git ls-files` (repository composition,
receipt lifecycle). Nothing here is a hand-drawn approximation.

### Pipeline architecture

Derived from [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Dipcatcher
estimates a market state at a point-in-time decision clock, then allocates
under constraints and costs. The optimizer consumes that state; a forecast
never bypasses the risk gate.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  raw["Raw market data"] --> pit["Point-in-time data layer"]
  pit --> feat["Feature engine and label engine"]
  feat --> state["Market-state forecasts"]
  state --> cal["Forecast calibration"]
  cal --> fusion["Forecast fusion"]
  fusion --> opt["Constrained portfolio optimizer"]
  opt --> risk["Pre-trade risk engine"]
  risk --> plan["Execution planner"]
  plan --> sim["Research, backtest, paper, or shadow"]
  sim --> mon["Attribution, monitoring, sealed receipts"]
  mon --> verify["dipcatcher verify-research"]
```

The market state at decision time holds expected return, features, alpha,
residual, volatility, covariance, regime probabilities, tail, liquidity, and
uncertainty. Features used at time `t` must have `available_time` at or
before `t`. The default fill for a close signal on day `t` is the next
available open. `robinhood+` is a K-line challenger whose default
`blend_weight` is `0` until it beats ridge on a causal synthetic card. The
architecture document also names a live runtime mode; config load rejects
it, exactly as the [checkout table](#what-you-get-in-this-checkout) below
says.

### Data flow

This is the literal, generated content of
[`docs/architecture/data_flow.mmd`](docs/architecture/data_flow.mmd) —
regenerate it with `python scripts/gen_arch_diagrams.py` if the source
changes; the `atlas` workflow fails the build if this file and the tree
disagree.

### Paper and shadow loop sequence

The literal, generated content of
[`docs/architecture/paper_loop_sequence.mmd`](docs/architecture/paper_loop_sequence.mmd),
covering one decision tick of `run_paper_loop()` end to end — resume,

### Receipt lifecycle

Unlike the two diagrams above, this state machine is not machine-generated —
it is a diagram I derived by hand from the verifier rules described in
[`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md), to make the
"sealed / verified / blocked" vocabulary used throughout this README
concrete. Treat the prose in that document as authoritative if the two ever
disagree.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: run started (research / backtest / fleet / bench)
    Draft --> ManifestSealed: run completes; receipt_sha256 computed
    ManifestSealed --> ValidationSealed: validation phase runs
    ValidationSealed --> Blocked: frozen slate fails or is untestable\n(valid=true, state="blocked")
    ValidationSealed --> TestSealed: validation passes
    TestSealed --> Verified: verify-research / verify-receipt\nrecompute hash, match
    TestSealed --> Rejected: hash mismatch or tamper detected\n(nonzero exit, no promotion)
    Blocked --> Verified: blocked tournaments are\nstill independently reverifiable
    Verified --> Indexed: optional binding into a\nphase1_evidence_index.json
    Blocked --> [*]: reviewable failure record\n(no test receipt, no candidate)
    Rejected --> [*]: promotion refused
    Indexed --> [*]: reproducible via\ndipcatcher verify-research <index>
    Verified --> [*]: eligible for suite-health,\ncorpus pooling, online-FDR replay
```

A **verified blocked** tournament (`valid: true`, `state: "blocked"`) is the
deliberate design choice at the center of this diagram: a candidate that
failed its frozen slate is not deleted, silently rerun, or hidden — it stays
in the tree as a reviewable, independently reverifiable failure, exactly
like [`adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json)
and [`basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json),
both cited again in [Evidence and sealed receipts](#evidence-and-sealed-receipts).

### Module dependency graph

The generated dependency graph collapses **881 internal Python modules**
(per `module_count` in
[`docs/architecture/manifest.json`](docs/architecture/manifest.json)) into
**63 top-level packages** (48 under `quant_fund`, 15 under `fx1`) connected
by **278 import edges**. It is large — that is the point of showing it
verbatim rather than summarizing it away. Expand it if you need to trace a
specific package boundary; otherwise the [pipeline architecture](#pipeline-architecture)
diagram above is the right altitude for most purposes.

### Repository composition

Counted directly from `git ls-files` at commit `c2d360b` (2026-09-30),
excluding dotfiles and dotdirectories: **3,012** tracked, non-hidden files.

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Tracked files by top-level area (3,012 total)
    "tests" : 1271
    "src" : 893
    "scripts" : 192
    "docs" : 182
    "web" : 102
    "third_party" : 93
    "receipts" : 63
    "data" : 30
    "configs" : 30
    "artifacts" : 30
    "other (25 areas)" : 126
```

`tests/` alone (1,271 files) is larger than the entire `src/` tree (893
files) — a ratio that is itself a small piece of evidence for how seriously
this repository takes verification over volume of production code. The
"other" wedge folds together 25 smaller top-level areas, the largest of
which are `verifier/` (24 files — acceptance-history receipts for the
harness's own turnover to fx-1), `replay/` (20), `research/` (18), `rust/`
(10, the optional `quant_core` native extension), `quality/` (7, ratchet
baselines for mypy/audit), `examples/` (7), `deploy/` (7, observability
stack config), `clients/` (5, a generated TypeScript API client), and
`spec/` (3, a TLA+ formal specification) — see
[Repository layout](#repository-layout) for what each of these is.

## Extended visual atlas

The [Visual tour](#visual-tour) above covers the six load-bearing diagrams.
This atlas goes wider: every diagram type below is a **map of structure,
ordering, or enforcement — never a performance claim**. Where a number
appears, it is a count taken from `git ls-files` or from a committed
receipt, labeled with the commit it was counted at (`e00ab310c`,
2026-09-30). Diagrams marked *illustrative* show ordering or shape, not
measured timing or measured satisfaction.

### System context

The whole lab in one picture. The load-bearing edge is the one that does
**not** exist: nothing in this tree talks to a broker.

```mermaid
C4Context
  title System context -- dipcatcher research lab (no live-trading surface)
  Person(researcher, "Researcher", "Runs gated research; reviews sealed receipts")
  System(harness, "dipcatcher harness", "quant_fund: PIT data, forecasts, fusion, optimizer, risk gate, simulated paper")
  System(fx1, "fx-1 tooling", "corpus / eval / training manifests; no trained checkpoint in tree")
  System_Ext(moonshot, "Moonshot hosted Kimi K3", "optional hosted eval; needs MOONSHOT_API_KEY")
  System_Ext(tapes, "Public exchange tapes", "opt-in collection only, e.g. Binance bars")
  System_Ext(broker, "Alpaca account", "referenced target venue -- NOT connected")
  Rel(researcher, harness, "Makefile targets, dipcatcher CLI")
  Rel(researcher, fx1, "fx1 CLI")
  Rel(harness, fx1, "gate-passed receipts become corpus lines")
  Rel(fx1, moonshot, "hosted base-model eval (opt-in)")
  Rel(harness, tapes, "dipcatcher collect (opt-in, network)")
  Rel(harness, broker, "REFUSED: allow_live=true raises")
```

### Research run lifecycle

Every research run is a state machine whose terminal states are all
reviewable. A failed run is sealed as a failure, never deleted and never
silently rerun until it looks better.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> configured: YAML/JSON config loaded (inherit chain)
  configured --> validated: schema + config-safety checks
  validated --> refused: unsupported source / non-finite parameter
  refused --> [*]: hard error, no artifacts
  validated --> running: panel built, PIT checks pass
  running --> sealed: notebook + receipt_sha256 written
  running --> blocked: gate fails (synthetic-as-live, missing family rows)
  sealed --> verified: verify-research recomputes hash, exit 0
  sealed --> invalid: hash mismatch / missing / non-finite metric
  invalid --> [*]: promotion refused, fail-closed
  blocked --> [*]: reviewable failure (valid: true, state: blocked)
  verified --> corpus: eligible receipt -> fx1 positive example
  blocked --> corpus: ineligible receipt -> fx1 negative example
  corpus --> [*]
```

### Receipt and data-manifest relationships

How the evidence objects relate. Every arrow is a hash: nothing references
anything it cannot recompute.

```mermaid
erDiagram
  CONFIG ||--|| RUN_MANIFEST : seeds
  DATA_MANIFEST ||--o{ BRONZE_PARQUET : "hashes rows+sha256"
  DATA_MANIFEST ||--o{ SILVER_PARQUET : "hashes rows+sha256"

  RECEIPT {

    string inputs_sha256
    string script_sha256
    bool research_only
    bool live_pnl_claim
  }
  DATA_MANIFEST {
    string source_identity
    int row_count
    string sha256
  }
```

### One gated run, stage order

The stages of a single gated research run, in order. Durations are unit
intervals — this shows *ordering and dependencies*, not measured wall time.

```mermaid
gantt
  title One gated research run (stage order, not to scale)
  dateFormat X
  axisFormat %s
  section Data
  Ingest + manifest :0, 1
  PIT checks + leakage scan :1, 2
  section Forecast
  Base forecasters :2, 4
  Fusion :4, 5
  section Decision
  Constrained optimizer :5, 6
  Risk gate :6, 7
  section Evidence
  Scorecard (proper scores only) :7, 9
  Seal + verify receipt :9, 10
```

### Acceptance history timeline

The harness's own acceptance ledger ([`verifier/`](verifier/), v1 through
v8, 24 files), condensed. Each version is a committed, reviewable
checkpoint of what the lab accepted about itself — see
[Repository health](#repository-health).

```mermaid
timeline
  title Harness acceptance history (verifier ledger)
  v1-v2 : Harness intake : evidence gates online : receipt sealing
  v3-v4 : Fail-closed promotion : doctor readiness checks : import boundaries
  v5-v6 : SOTA catalog versioning : dual honesty catalogs : blocked receipts reviewable
  v7 : qlib parity benchmark sealed
  v8 : 88 host-local run manifests folded into corpus : 77 positive, 11 negative
```

### The harness at a glance

The 47 top-level subpackages under `src/quant_fund`, grouped by job. This
is a reading aid, not an import graph — the enforced import boundaries
live in [`configs/arch_boundaries.toml`](configs/arch_boundaries.toml) and
are checked by the `arch-guards` workflow.

### Capability vs evidence

An *illustrative* placement of major surfaces on two axes: how strong the
committed evidence is, and how deployment-shaped the surface is. The upper
right is where a live claim would have to live — nothing sits there.

```mermaid
quadrantChart
  title Capability x evidence (illustrative posture, not a performance claim)
  x-axis weak evidence --> strong evidence
  y-axis simulation-only --> deployment-shaped
  quadrant-1 closest to readiness, still blocked
  quadrant-2 aspirational, unproven
  quadrant-3 correctness tests
  quadrant-4 implemented, simulated
  "Sealed receipts": [0.9, 0.35]
  "PIT data contract": [0.8, 0.45]
  "Paper/shadow loop": [0.7, 0.55]
  "Formal spec (TLA+)": [0.85, 0.25]
  "Vendor data entitlement": [0.15, 0.8]
  "Broker adapter": [0.05, 0.9]
  "Five live-evidence conditions": [0.02, 0.95]
```

### Tracked-file census

Counted from `git ls-files` at `e00ab310c` (3,016 tracked, non-hidden
files). The bar chart makes the same point the pie chart in
[Repository composition](#repository-composition) makes: this is a
verification-heavy repository.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
  title "Tracked files by area (git ls-files @ e00ab310c)"
  x-axis [tests, src, scripts, docs, web, third_party, receipts, data, configs, artifacts]
  bar [1277, 900, 192, 182, 102, 93, 63, 30, 30, 30]
```

### Python module census

Python files only, same commit: the harness's 821 modules, the fx-1 lane's
61, and 1,174 `test_*.py` files standing over both.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
  title "Python files (git ls-files @ e00ab310c)"
  x-axis ["quant_fund modules", "fx1 modules", "test files"]
  y-axis "files" 0 --> 1300
  bar [821, 61, 1174]
```

### Receipt census

63 committed JSON artifacts under [`receipts/`](receipts/): 55 sealed
receipts at the top level, 7 legacy-unsealed receipts kept for history,
plus one README (full listing in the [Appendix](#receipts-census)).

```mermaid
pie showData
  title Committed receipt files (62 JSON + 1 README @ e00ab310c)
  "sealed receipts/" : 55
  "legacy-unsealed" : 7
```

### Corpus flywheel

Receipts are fx-1's training data. Eligible receipts become positive
examples; fail-closed refusals become negative examples. Counts from the
[fx-1](#fx-1) section: 5 eligible seed receipts, plus 88 host-local
research-run manifests yielding 77 positive (SYNTHETIC-labeled, simulated
data, never market evidence) and 11 negative lines.

### Turnover history, illustrative

Commits land directly on `main` for fx-1 lanes (see `AGENTS.md`); the
branch below is an *illustrative* sketch of the harness's turnover into
the fx-1 lab, not a branch-by-branch history.

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "harness intake"
  commit id: "receipt sealing"
  branch fx1-lane
  commit id: "corpus build"
  commit id: "honesty mirror"
  checkout main
  commit id: "SOTA catalog"
  merge fx1-lane id: "v8 acceptance"
  commit id: "wave 17 DiffPTS"
  commit id: "HEAD e00ab310"
```

### A researcher's day

Illustrative satisfaction scores (1-5) for a typical gated day — the shape
of the workflow, not a measurement.

```mermaid
journey
  title A researcher's day with the harness (illustrative)
  section Morning
    make sync: 4: Researcher
    make doctor: 3: Researcher
  section Midday
    run research on SYNTHETIC panel: 5: Researcher
    verify-research recomputes seal: 5: Researcher, Verifier
  section Evening
    read sealed receipt: 4: Researcher
    fx1 corpus build: 4: Researcher
```

### Honesty gate decision tree

What happens to any candidate result before it can be headlined. Every
"no" edge is fail-closed and leaves a reviewable artifact behind.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["candidate result"] --> B{"data.source == synthetic?"}
  B -->|"yes"| C["label DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC everywhere"]
  B -->|"no"| D{"headline key in FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS?"}
  C --> D
  D -->|"yes"| E["REJECT — fail-closed"]
  D -->|"no"| F{"all metrics present and finite?"}
  F -->|"no"| E
  F -->|"yes"| G{"receipt_sha256 recomputes byte-for-byte?"}
  G -->|"no"| E
  G -->|"yes"| H["seal and verify; eligible for corpus"]
  E --> I["blocked receipt kept as reviewable failure"]
```

### verify-research call sequence

The authoritative check. The web explorer's panels are informational;
this is the one that exits nonzero.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant U as User
  participant CLI as dipcatcher verify-research
  participant FS as receipts/
  participant V as verifier
  U->>CLI: verify-research [path]
  CLI->>FS: load notebook + receipt fields
  CLI->>V: recompute receipt_sha256 over other fields
  V-->>CLI: match / mismatch
  alt hash matches and metrics finite
    CLI-->>U: exit 0 — valid
  else mismatch, missing, or non-finite
    CLI-->>U: exit nonzero — fail-closed
  end
```

### Config inheritance

Every scenario file inherits from `base.yaml` and overrides only what it
changes. Frozen protocol files are a separate kind of object entirely —
loaded via `SotaProtocol`, never as `AppConfig`, and never edited after a
receipt cites their `protocol_sha256`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  base["base.yaml — runtime.mode: research, allow_live: false"]
  base --> research["research.yaml"]
  base --> paper["paper.yaml"]
  base --> backtest["backtest.yaml"]
  base --> demo["demo.yaml / demo_minute.yaml"]
  base --> production["production.yaml — historical name, research-strict"]
  paper --> simlive["sim_live.yaml"]
  frozen["sota_protocol*.yaml — frozen scoring contracts"] -.->|"SotaProtocol, not AppConfig"| research
```

### Config class anatomy

A sketch of the config object model; the authoritative definitions live in
`src/quant_fund/config` and `src/fx1/train`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class AppConfig {
    +RuntimeConfig runtime
    +DataConfig data
    +validate() bool
  }
  class RuntimeConfig {
    +str mode
    +bool allow_live
  }
  class DataConfig {
    +str source
  }
  class SotaProtocol {
    +str protocol_sha256
  }
  class TrainConfig {
    +str stage
    +int min_nodes_final_k3
  }
  AppConfig *-- RuntimeConfig
  AppConfig *-- DataConfig
  note for SotaProtocol "Frozen contract; not an AppConfig."
  note for TrainConfig "FINAL_K3 requires at least 2 nodes, enforced in code."
```

### Receipt field map

A conceptual bit-map of what a sealed receipt carries. This is a teaching
diagram — the authoritative format is the JSON itself plus
[`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md).

```mermaid
packet-beta
  title Receipt field map (conceptual)
  0-15: "receipt_sha256"
  16-31: "inputs_sha256"
  32-47: "script_sha256"
  48-55: "research_only = true"
  56-63: "live_pnl_claim = false"
```

### Documentation reading order

111 top-level documents under [`docs/`](docs/) is a lot. This is the order
the lab itself would hand a new reader; the full map is in
[Documentation index](#documentation-index).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  readme["README.md"] --> first["Read this first"]
  first --> arch["docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"]
  arch --> contracts["docs/DATA_CONTRACTS.md"]

## What you get in this checkout

| Surface | What it is |
|---|---|
| `configs/research.yaml`, `configs/paper.yaml` | `data.source: synthetic`. The CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`. These runs are labeled correctness tests, not market evidence. |
| `receipts/` | Committed research artifacts. Each file sets `research_only: true` and carries its own disclaimer string. |
| `src/quant_fund` | The research pipeline: point-in-time data, forecasts, fusion, a constrained optimizer, a risk gate, and simulated paper (893 files, 48 top-level subpackages). |
| `src/fx1` | Corpus, eval, and training-manifest code at `0.4.0`. No model weights are in the tree. |
| `web/` | A read-only explorer UI over sealed receipts and evidence (102 files) — see [Web explorer and tooling](#web-explorer-and-tooling). |
| `clients/typescript` | A generated TypeScript client (`openapi.json`, `client.ts`, `schema.d.ts`) for the FastAPI service's OpenAPI schema. |
| `verifier/` | The repository's own acceptance-history ledger for its turnover into the fx-1 harness (`v1`…`v8`, 24 files) — see [Repository health](#repository-health). |
| **Live orders** | **Refused.** Setting `runtime.allow_live: true` raises `allow_live is unsupported: no live broker adapter in this repository`. |

Research scores that the lab will headline are proper scores: pinball,
CRPS, PIT, QLIKE, Brier, ECE, Kupiec, and HMM likelihood — never Sharpe,
Sortino, Calmar, P&L, or NAV as a standalone result (see
[Read this first](#read-this-first)).

## What makes it different

- **Sealed receipts.** Phase-1 benchmark and tournament files carry
  `receipt_sha256`, the SHA-256 of the other fields.
  `dipcatcher verify-research` recomputes it and exits nonzero on a mismatch
  ([`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md)). Paper
  promotion receipts use the same seal. Files under `receipts/` record the
  input and script hashes the result claims (`inputs_sha256`,
  `script_sha256`, `bar_files_sha256`, and related fields).
- **Fail-closed verification.** An invalid notebook, a missing metric, or a
  non-finite metric does not promote. SYNTHETIC evidence marked as live
  fails the gate in `quant_fund.validation.gates`. `dipcatcher doctor` exits
  nonzero until a data manifest and a valid research receipt are both
  present.
- **Published negative results.**
  [`adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json)
  records `selected_band: null` and `eligible: false` on every candidate.
  [`basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json)
  records `development_eligible: false`. A sealed blocked tournament stays a
  reviewable failure (`valid: true`, `state: "blocked"`) with no test
  receipt and no selected candidate
  ([`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md)).
- **A parity receipt against an external incumbent.**
  [`incumbent_bench_qlib.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/incumbent_bench_qlib.json)
  is one matched workload against Microsoft's
  [`qlib`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib) `0.9.7` on real Binance daily
  bars (`BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`), with `research_only: true` and
  `live_pnl_claim: false`. Full numbers, including all five repetitions and
  the four documented semantic differences between the two engines, are in
  [Evidence and sealed receipts](#evidence-and-sealed-receipts).
- **Synthetic stays labeled.** Default research and paper configs set
  `data.source: synthetic`. The CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC` and the
  word `SYNTHETIC`. The CI smoke test fails if that notebook's
  `data_source` is anything else.
- **Formal verification, not just unit tests.** A TLA+ specification under
  [`spec/tla`](spec/tla) model-checks the order lifecycle with TLC, backed
  by Z3 and stateful property tests (`make formal`,
  [`docs/FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/FORMAL_VERIFICATION.md)).

## Quick start

Python 3.12 or 3.13, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From a clone:

```bash
make sync
uv run dipcatcher research --config configs/research.yaml
uv run dipcatcher verify-research
uv run dipcatcher doctor --config configs/research.yaml
```

`configs/research.yaml` is synthetic. `research` builds that panel, writes a
notebook under `data/metadata/research/`, and prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`.
`verify-research` checks `data/metadata/research/latest.json` and exits
nonzero when the notebook is invalid. `doctor` exits `0` only after the data
manifest and that receipt both check out; on a fresh tree, before
`research`, it exits `1`.

Simulated paper, also synthetic, capped the way CI caps it:

```bash
uv run dipcatcher paper --config configs/paper.yaml --max-steps 2
```

A labeled-SYNTHETIC offline demo dataset, if you want bars without any
network access at all:

```bash
make demo-data
uv run dipcatcher research --config configs/demo.yaml
```

Public collection is opt-in and is separate from ingest. It needs a
network:

```bash
uv run dipcatcher collect --help
```

## Configuration

Every run reads one YAML (or, for frozen protocols and tournaments, JSON)
file under [`configs/`](configs/). Configs use an `inherit:` chain rooted at
`base.yaml`, so a scenario file only overrides what it changes. Comments
below are taken directly from each file's own header.

| Config | Purpose (verbatim from the file's own header comment) |
|---|---|
| `base.yaml` | Root config: `runtime.mode: research`, `runtime.allow_live: false`, universe and defaults every other file inherits. |
| `research.yaml` | `runtime.mode: research`; the default synthetic research run used throughout [Quick start](#quick-start). |
| `paper.yaml` | `runtime.mode: paper`, `allow_live: false`; drives `run_paper_loop()` (see [paper and shadow loop sequence](#paper-and-shadow-loop-sequence)). |
| `backtest.yaml` | `runtime.mode: backtest`; event-driven, next-open fills, explicit cost model. |
| `production.yaml` | *"NOT a live broker / production trading profile."* Historical name kept for path stability; research-strict. |
| `demo.yaml` / `demo_minute.yaml` | Offline demo configs reading `make demo-data` output; labeled `source="synthetic"`, correctness testing only. |
| `pretrade_risk.yaml` | Pre-trade risk snapshot; shadow evaluation only; the HMAC key is supplied at load time, never stored in the file. |
| `sim_live.yaml` | Inherits `paper.yaml`; real collected Binance bars through the paper loop with quantile-signal strategies — still simulated fills, no live claim. |
| `hedge_lab.yaml` / `hedge_lab_wide.yaml` | Paper/backtest **analytics** catalog where Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar are deliberately scoped — *"live here, not in research family blobs"* — per the dual-catalog rule in [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness). Session-close tape, not SIP; not a live P&L claim. |
| `stress_research.yaml` | Research-only factor book for the stress-report smoke; weights are scenario exposures, not a live allocation. |
| `sota_g1.yaml`, `sota_file.yaml`, `sota_file_uk.yaml` | SYNTHETIC or public-file-tape cards for the SOTA protocol lane; engine-correctness only, not promotion. |
| `sota_protocol.yaml`, `sota_protocol_v2.yaml`, `sota_protocol_v2_lanes.yaml` | Frozen scoring contracts — *"do not edit after a receipt cites `protocol_sha256`."* Not `AppConfig` objects; loaded via `SotaProtocol`. |
| `net_tournament.json`, `cost_aware_tournament.json` | Frozen tournament slates: a benchmark plus named trial candidates, each with a family and lookback. |
| `real_benchmark_us_wide.json` | Points at a hash-pinned dataset (`dataset_sha256`) and its `source_url` on this repository, for a reproducible real-data benchmark run. |
| `forward_shadow.example.json` | Example strategy definition for the forward-shadow record ([`docs/FORWARD_SHADOW_RECORD.md`](docs/FORWARD_SHADOW_RECORD.md)). |
| `fx1_harness.example.yaml` | Smoke config for the fx-1 inference harness; forecaster is *dummy-zero, a reference baseline — not fx-1*. |
| `fx1_run.example.json` | Example immutable run manifest (`run_name`, `stage`, `base_model: moonshotai/Kimi-K3`) for the fx-1 training ladder. |
| `arch_boundaries.toml` | Import-layer boundaries for `quant_fund` (+ `fx1` coupling rules), enforced by `scripts/check_import_boundaries.py` and the `arch-guards` workflow. |

## Command line reference

Both CLIs are [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) applications. The
commands used in [Quick start](#quick-start) cover the common path; the
tables below are the complete, source-derived reference for everything
else. Every description is either quoted from the command's own Python
docstring or, where a command has no docstring, written to match the
generated diagrams in [Visual tour](#visual-tour).

**The ten commands you are most likely to reach for:**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `uv run dipcatcher research --config <cfg>` | Builds a panel, runs the research pipeline, writes a sealed notebook. |
| `uv run dipcatcher verify-research [path]` | Recomputes a notebook or run directory's receipt hash; fails closed. |
| `uv run dipcatcher doctor --config <cfg>` | Environment/data/receipt readiness check; exit code is the answer. |
| `uv run dipcatcher paper --config <cfg> --max-steps N` | Runs the simulated champion/shadow paper loop for N steps. |
| `uv run dipcatcher backtest --config <cfg>` | Event-driven backtest with next-open fills. |
| `uv run dipcatcher ingest --config <cfg>` | Point-in-time ingest into bronze/silver parquet plus a data manifest. |
| `uv run dipcatcher collect <source>` | Opt-in public data collection (needs network). |
| `uv run dipcatcher api` | Starts the FastAPI research service (loopback by default). |
| `uv run fx1 corpus build --receipts-dir receipts --out <path>` | Builds the fx-1 SFT corpus from gate-passed receipts. |
| `uv run fx1 doctor` | fx-1 readiness status (presence flags only, never secret values). |

## Data sources and point in time integrity

Dipcatcher separates **what a source is** from **what it is allowed to
claim**, and it does this in two distinct places: the research harness's own
public collectors, and fx-1's much broader professional-datasource router
used only for corpus construction. They are not the same subsystem, and
this README will not conflate them.

### Harness data sources (`quant_fund`)

From [`docs/DATA_SOURCE_LABELS.md`](docs/DATA_SOURCE_LABELS.md): configured
sources are explicit — `synthetic` uses the labeled simulator; `file` and
`parquet` use the local CSV/Parquet adapter; unknown source identifiers are
**rejected at configuration time**, never silently routed to a fallback.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SYNTHETIC` | Planted-factor / simulator panel. Recovering IC, coverage, or bandit regret is an **engine correctness** test — never a production promotion input. |
| `public` / `file` | Features built from a configured non-synthetic adapter (parquet, Stooq session-close tape, etc.). Scores stay scientific (proper rules), not a live-P&L claim. Session-close `available_time` is **not** a SIP vintage. |
| `public sources` | Registered open/public feeds collected explicitly via `dipcatcher collect` — Binance klines, FRED/ALFRED, US Treasury, CFTC COT, FINRA short volume, World Bank, BEA, GDELT, SEC EDGAR, NASDAQ ITCH sample, FI-2010, and the Hugging Face `hf_ohlcv_1m` adapter. Point-in-time stamped (`event_time` / `available_time` / `ingested_time`, `source`, `revision_id`) with a per-collection JSON receipt (SHA-256, row counts, provenance). Still research evidence, never a live-P&L claim. |

US names use the NYSE and NASDAQ common-stock universe, with public daily
and minute bars available through those opt-in collectors. Crypto research
uses public Binance series. Alpaca is an **offline quote-column preset** for
book panels, not a live brokerage connection anywhere in this repository.

The collect → promote → ingest path for bar-capable sources:

```bash
dipcatcher collect --config configs/sota_file.yaml --source yahoo \
  --param names=AAPL:AAPL,MSFT:MSFT --param start=2026-08-01
dipcatcher promote-bars --config configs/sota_file.yaml --source yahoo
dipcatcher ingest --config configs/sota_file.yaml
```

`promote-bars` publishes the collected frame as `bars.parquet`, enforces the
bars contract the provider enforces at read time, refuses to overwrite
without `--force`, and writes a `bar_promotion.v1` receipt chaining the
source parquet and collect-receipt SHA-256s to the published file.

Fail-closed rules that hold regardless of source: SYNTHETIC evidence cannot
receive a champion or live alias; `dipcatcher validate --claim-live` on
SYNTHETIC evidence fails (`ok=false`); a missing causal weight panel **and**
missing walk-forward/notebook evidence together fail validation.

### fx-1's professional datasource router

A separate, much larger surface exists purely to build the fx-1 training
corpus: [`docs/FX1_DATASOURCES.md`](docs/FX1_DATASOURCES.md) documents **18
professional finance sources** wired behind one honest interface — Wind
(万得), iFinD (同花顺), Gildata (恒生聚源), S&P CapIQ, SEC EDGAR, Yahoo
Finance, 东方财富妙想, 财联社 (CLS), 财新数据, Binance, IMF, World Bank,
IGO/FRED, 新华财经, a `finance-research` aggregator, 天眼查, a
`finance-fetch` router, and 进门投研 (Finenter, MCP-only). Design invariants,
quoted from the source document:

1. **No fabrication, ever.** Adapters execute the plugins' own bundled CLI
   scripts via subprocess; a failure returns `FetchResult(ok=False)` with
   the real error, never placeholder data.
2. **Credentials are environment-only** and never appear on argv, in logs,
   or in prompts.
3. **Point-in-time discipline.** Sources with `requires_as_of=true` cannot
   enter the training corpus without an explicit `as_of` observation date —
   the leakage guard refuses the ingest (exit `1`) and records the
   exclusion in the ledger.
4. **Live-claim quarantine.** Payloads asserting live trading performance
   become *negative* training examples that teach refusal, never positives.
5. **Tamper-evident provenance.** Every ingested payload is hash-chained:
   payload hash → ingest-code hash → example hash.
6. **Honest degradation.** Routing walks candidates in authority order;
   every skip or failure is recorded with its reason. MCP-only sources
   report `MCP_REQUIRED` rather than pretending offline capability.

```bash
fx1 sources list                      # all 18 sources + live probe status
fx1 sources probe [name]              # availability JSON (no secret values)
fx1 sources describe <name>           # the source's own capability docs
fx1 sources route --question "..."    # classified need + probed candidates
fx1 sources fetch <name> --api X --params-json '{...}' --as-of YYYY-MM-DD
fx1 sources scenarios                 # finance-fetch scenario coverage
fx1 corpus ingest-source <name> --api X --as-of ... \
    --ledger-path data/fx1/corpus_ledger.jsonl --out data/fx1/corpus.jsonl
```

The document also records a dated live-verification note (2026-09-25): a
real Binance 24-hour BTCUSDT ticker fetch (payload hash prefix `bc31361c…`,
2.1 seconds) and a CLS telegraph ingest that chained into the ledger
(`chain_valid: true`) — both are one-time, timestamped smoke checks, not a
standing SLA. Boundaries are stated honestly in the same document: adapters
are only as available as the host (missing script → `no_script`, missing
credentials → `no_credentials`, MCP-only → `mcp_required`), and true
point-in-time *vendor* snapshots for revisable fundamentals remain a
data-procurement gap that the `as_of` gate enforces discipline around but
cannot manufacture on its own.

## Research methodology

[`docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md`](docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md) opens with a sentence
worth repeating verbatim, because it is the thesis of the entire repository:

> Dipcatcher is Artificial Hedge's **proprietary research lab**. It measures
> forecast quality with proper scoring rules. It does not exist to
> manufacture Sharpe ratios.

`dipcatcher research` scores every one of the families below with a proper
scoring rule or a calibration/coverage test — never with backtested P&L. The
canonical verifier requires a versioned **23-family core catalog**
([`docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md`](docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md)); the
table here (24 rows) additionally includes the optional `robinhood+` K-line
challenger family. Notation has been lightly adapted from the source
document's LaTeX for plain-Markdown rendering — treat
[`docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md`](docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md) as authoritative for
exact mathematical notation.

| Family | Scientific scores |
|---|---|
| Ranking | Date-level IC / RankIC, HAC t, decile monotonicity. Public-feature challengers: `rff`, `rff_ridgeless`, `sdf_ridge`, `sdf_en`, `ipca`, `ipca_alpha`, `rp_pca`, `fnw`, `gx3pass`, `ds_lasso`, `fm`, `fm_ridge`, `pcr`, `pls`, `tprf`, `gbrt`, `pp`, `combo`, `combo_ic`, `alasso`, `classic` (ADR-026/027/028/029/030). Sign-flip mirror books (ADR-032) are paper diagnostics: costs do not flip. Champion remains public ridge until a non-SYNTHETIC card wins. Pairwise DM is on −IC, not Sharpe. |
| Alpha | Holdout MSE vs historical mean, Pearson IC |
| Volatility | QLIKE, Diebold–Mariano |
| Distribution | Pinball, CRPS, interval coverage, crossing, PIT KS (raw Gaussian + vol-scaled Gaussian / Student-t / standardized empirical residuals); 1d and 5d scored as separate keys |
| Regime | HMM AIC/BIC, holdout average log-likelihood |
| Tail | Historical VaR/ES; headline Kupiec is vol-scaled; unscaled kept as diagnostic |
| Drawdown | Brier, log-loss, ECE vs base rate |
| Liquidity | Amihud correlation, Almgren–Chriss vs TWAP shortfall |
| Reinforcement | LinUCB top-k on **public** features; regret vs planted oracle; advantage vs uniform |
| Conformal | Operational CQR/ACI/Mondrian wrap scaled (t) bands; `cqr_raw`/`aci_raw` show misspecification repair; \|Y\| slice is not an X-validity claim |
| E-values | Anytime-valid miss e-process on ACI sets (Ville); coverage, (Eₙ), ever-cross |
| Jackknife+ | Leave-one-out conformal coverage and width; finite-sample floor (1 − 2α) (bound check, not a Kupiec null) |
| CRC | CRC on scaled (t) VaR bounds (same wrappee as two-sided); homoskedastic Gaussian is diagnostic |
| Weighted conformal | Likelihood-ratio split CQR coverage and width vs exchangeable CQR |
| Interval risk | Equal-weight (1/n) per date, then interval caps; bind_wide vs bind_tight (no P&L) |
| Quantile bandit | Quantile Thompson on **public** features; regret vs residual oracle |
| CV+ / JAW | Date-folded CV+; minmax floor (1 − α), plus/JAW floor (1 − 2α) |
| Localized conformal | RBF-weighted CQR on PIT-safe volatility; coverage and width |
| Conformal rank sets | Date-grouped top-k set size, FDR, and oracle hit; no P&L |
| Online CRC | Sequential monotone-loss risk control by date; no cross-sectional time stacking |
| Portfolio conformal | One CQR set per date for the scalar book return (wᵀ r) |
| Northset | OHLC / book / session identities; candle geometry + CLV; Parkinson / Garman–Klass / Rogers–Satchell / Yang–Zhang / overnight-split QLIKE; Kyle λ, Roll, Corwin–Schultz, Abdi–Ranaldo, Amihud, OFI, VPIN; liquidity sweeps; date-level ICs; BNS jumps |
| CPCV audit | Combinatorial purged/embargoed date folds; integrity only, no return claim |
| robinhood+ (optional) | Kronos-derived K-line path IC on split-adjusted OHLCV; hierarchical tokens + autoregression; not a live claim |

**What is explicitly not a lab headline:** Sharpe, PSR, DSR, CSCV-PBO, and
simulated P&L stay out of the research notebook by design. Those belong to
optional execution backtests and the separate `analytics_export` /
`hedge_lab*` diagnostics catalog, never to the scientific benches above (see
the dual-catalog rule in [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness)).

BH-FDR pooling respects hypothesis-family boundaries rather than treating
every p-value as fungible: **calibration** families (fail-to-reject is
success) are never pooled with **discovery** families (reject is a finding),
and bound checks such as the Jackknife+ coverage floor are their own third
category. The full 49-hypothesis breakdown is in
[`docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md`](docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md#hypothesis-families).

Beyond the family catalog, three more layers of methodology apply to every
research run:

| Layer | What it checks | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Validation integrity | Walk-forward, purge/embargo, CPCV audit, HAC/Diebold-Mariano, multiple-testing and conformal-family gates; anytime-valid e-BH/e-LORD/e-SAFFRON online FDR; rank confidence sequences; a frozen post-submission-only betting referee for agent-proposed factors | [`docs/VALIDATION.md`](docs/VALIDATION.md) |
| Stress testing | Research stress catalog, scenario replay, reverse stress, VaR/ES backtests | [`docs/STRESS.md`](docs/STRESS.md) |
| Robustness | Strategy robustness certificates, adversarial attacks, and a receipt stamp (`extensions_schema_version: 1`) | [`docs/ROBUSTNESS.md`](docs/ROBUSTNESS.md) |

## Evidence and sealed receipts

Every number in this section is copied from a committed, hash-sealed
receipt under [`receipts/`](receipts/). Regenerate the rendered evidence
index with `make evidence`
([`docs/evidence/index.md`](docs/evidence/index.md)); recompute any single
receipt's seal with `uv run dipcatcher verify-receipt <path>`.

### Dip-recovery bench

[`receipts/legacy-unsealed/dip_bench_crypto_1d_20260925.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/dip_bench_crypto_1d_20260925.json)
(schema `fx1.dip_bench/v1`, generated 2026-09-25, `research_only: true`,
`n_events: 176`, drawdown threshold `10%`) scores an **in-sample
climatology baseline** — not a tradeable signal — on 11 historical crypto
series: given that a 10% drawdown has occurred, what fraction of those 176
events had recovered by each horizon?

```text
1m  (21 trading days)   ███████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 21.59%
3m  (63 trading days)   ██████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 51.14%

```

Disclaimer, copied verbatim from the receipt:

> Research/backtest evidence on historical data, not live performance. The
> climatology forecaster is an in-sample descriptive baseline; it is not a
> tradeable signal and authorizes nothing.

`fx1 dipbench` runs the same bench — a SYNTHETIC smoke without
`--data-dir`, or a full receipt over real historical bars with it.

### qlib parity receipt

[`receipts/legacy-unsealed/incumbent_bench_qlib.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/incumbent_bench_qlib.json)
(schema `incumbent_bench.v1`, `research_only: true`, `live_pnl_claim: false`)
is one matched workload against Microsoft
[`qlib`](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib) `0.9.7`, replaying identical
orders through both engines: a causal SMA-20 gate strategy, equal-weight
0.9/3 per gated name, on real Binance daily bars for `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`,
and `SOLUSDT` (999 bars/asset, 997 common trading dates), starting from
$1,000,000 notional, 10 bps commission, decision close `t` → execution open
`t+1`.

**Correctness (NAV agreement between the two independent implementations —
not a return or performance figure):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Final NAV, dipcatcher | $1,500,764.66 |
| Final NAV, qlib 0.9.7 | $1,498,592.66 |
| Max absolute NAV difference | $0.18 (on ~$1.5M) |
| Max relative NAV difference | `1.0290734772388363e-07` |
| Common trading dates | 997 |
| Fills (dipcatcher) | 1,587 |
| Order days (qlib) | 670 |

**Wall-clock latency, five repetitions each (milliseconds, single process):**

| Rep | dipcatcher | qlib 0.9.7 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 105.75 | 9,469.53 |
| 2 | 101.36 | 10,510.51 |
| 3 | 97.17 | 18,078.94 |
| 4 | 99.12 | 16,197.97 |
| 5 | 103.04 | 10,579.35 |
| **Median** | **101.36** | **10,579.35** |

The median ratio is **≈104.4×** for this one workload, on this one machine
(`darwin`, Python `3.12.13`), for a single-process, in-memory replay — not a
general claim about either engine's architecture, and not evidence of
anything about live execution latency.

Disclaimer, copied verbatim from the receipt:

> Single matched workload vs qlib 0.9.x on real Binance daily bars.
> Correctness is NAV parity; latency is single-process wall time. Not a
> claim of superiority across all product dimensions.

<details>
<summary><strong>Four documented semantic differences between the two engines</strong> (also copied verbatim from the receipt)</summary>

1. qlib quotes are float32 (`.bin` format); dipcatcher uses float64 parquet
   prices. Residual NAV divergence is f32 price quantization (~1e-7
   relative, ~$0.18 worst day on ~$1.5M).
2. qlib order generation sells down before buys within a step and clips buy
   amounts to cash+cost; dipcatcher rejects a whole order that would
   overdraw. The workload keeps a 0.9 weight-sum buffer so neither policy
   binds.
3. qlib's default order generators renormalize weights to sum to 1 and floor
   amounts to integer units; a custom `OrderGenerator` (`MatchedOrderGen`)
   applies dipcatcher's exact sizing, `target_units = w * NAV / open`.
4. `limit_threshold=None` does **not** disable qlib's price-limit halt: it
   falls back to `C.limit_threshold` (0.095 for `region=cn`) and silently
   drops orders on >9.5% daily moves. `limit_threshold=1e9` disables it.
   Without this fix, NAV diverged ~14% on this workload.

</details>

### Published negative results

A failed candidate is sealed, not deleted. Two examples, both cited earlier
in [What makes it different](#what-makes-it-different) and diagrammed in
[Receipt lifecycle](#receipt-lifecycle):

- [`adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json) —
  `selected_band: null` and `eligible: false` on every candidate band.
- [`basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json`](receipts/legacy-unsealed/basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json) —
  `development_eligible: false`.

Both stay `valid: true`, `state: "blocked"` under
[`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md)'s rules: a
reviewable failure record, with no test receipt and no selected candidate —
never silently rerun until something looks better.

### Research 100

[100 source-linked research references](docs/RESEARCH100_CATALOG.md) map to
executable components and tests. [Usage and evidence](docs/RESEARCH100.md)
cover new cost-aware allocation, risk-constrained Kelly, causal volatility
management, and serial-adjusted evaluation. Existing components and new
work are explicitly distinguished; **no claim of 100 reproduced studies or
demonstrated market-performance uplift is made.**

## Deep dives

Long-form, reference-grade walk-throughs of the objects this repository is
built around. Everything here restates enforcement that lives in code —
where prose and code could ever disagree, the code and the sealed receipts
win.

### Anatomy of a sealed receipt

A receipt is a JSON document whose seal field, `receipt_sha256`, is the
SHA-256 of the canonical serialization of every other field. Schematic
sketch — field names vary by receipt family, and the committed files under
[`receipts/`](receipts/) are authoritative:

```json
{
  "schema": "dipcatcher.research.notebook/v1",
  "research_only": true,
  "live_pnl_claim": false,
  "git_revision": "<commit the run was produced at>",
  "dirty_worktree": false,
  "inputs_sha256": "<sha256 over config + dataset inputs>",
  "script_sha256": "<sha256 over the producing code path>",
  "metrics": {
    "pinball": "<quantile loss>",
    "crps": "<distributional score>",
    "pit": "<calibration histogram data>"
  },
  "receipt_sha256": "<sha256 over all fields above>"
}
```

Headline keys `sharpe`, `sortino`, `calmar`, `pnl`, and `nav` are rejected
by the research catalog *before* a notebook can be sealed, so a `metrics`
blob like the above is not a convention — it is the only shape the code
will emit.

| Field family | What it binds | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| identity | schema version, run name, producing stage | schema validation at load |
| provenance | git revision, dirty-worktree flag, runtime, package versions | fields recomputed on re-verify |
| inputs | config hash, dataset content hash, bar-file hashes | `inputs_sha256`, `bar_files_sha256` |
| scores | proper scores only | `FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS` at the catalog |
| posture | `research_only: true`, `live_pnl_claim: false` | validation gates, fail-closed |
| seal | `receipt_sha256` over all other fields | `dipcatcher verify-research` |

### Lifecycle of a single forecast

From raw bars to sealed evidence, one forecast passes through eight stages.
No stage is skippable: a stage that cannot produce its evidence stops the
run.

| # | Stage | Home package | Refuses when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | point-in-time panel | `data`, `pit` | late aggregates, duplicate keys, OHLCV violations |
| 2 | feature build | `features` | lookahead (leakage scan), non-stationary synthetic persistence |
| 3 | base forecasts | `models`, `quant_models`, `hmm` | non-finite outputs |

| 6 | risk gate | `risk`, `pretrade` | breached limits; HMAC key supplied at load time, never stored |

### Choosing a config

All configs live under [`configs/`](configs/) and inherit from
`base.yaml`; the full per-file table is in [Configuration](#configuration)
and the census is in the [Appendix](#configs-census).

### Proper-score field guide

The lab headlines proper scores and calibration tests, never risk-adjusted
return ratios. Definitions below use `y` for the realized outcome, `F` for
the predictive CDF, `q` for a predictive quantile at level `tau`, `p` for
an event probability, and `o` for a 0/1 outcome.

```text
pinball (quantile) loss, level tau:
    L_tau(y, q) = (y - q) * (tau - 1{y < q})

CRPS, predictive CDF F, outcome y:
    CRPS(F, y) = integral_z ( F(z) - 1{z >= y} )^2 dz

PIT value:
    u = F(y)      over many cases, u ~ Uniform(0, 1) if calibrated

QLIKE, volatility proxy x^2, forecast h:
    QLIKE = log(h) + x^2 / h

Brier score, probability p, outcome o in {0, 1}:
    BS = (p - o)^2

ECE, bins B_m:
    ECE = sum_m ( |B_m| / n ) * | acc(B_m) - conf(B_m) |

Kupiec unconditional coverage, x exceptions in N trials at rate p:
    LR = -2 * ln( (1-p)^(N-x) p^x / ( (1 - x/N)^(N-x) (x/N)^x ) )

HMM log-likelihood, forward normalizers c_t:
    ll = sum_t log(c_t)
```

Why these and not Sharpe: a proper scoring rule is minimized in
expectation by reporting the true predictive distribution, so a forecaster
cannot game the headline by being lucky, overfit, or selectively honest.
Sharpe-style ratios measure a *trading outcome* — which this repository
has none of, because there is no live trading.

### Honesty enforcement map

The honesty contract is a set of code points, not a policy page. Each row
names the enforcement point, its mirror on the other side of the
harness/model boundary, and the check that keeps them honest.

| Rule | Enforced in | Mirrored in | Checked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| forbidden headline keys | `quant_fund.research.catalog.registry.FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS` | `fx1.honesty.FORBIDDEN_HEADLINE_TOKENS` | `tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py` |
| SYNTHETIC labeling | CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC` | notebook `data_source` field | CI smoke test |
| no live trading | `runtime.allow_live: true` raises | `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md` five conditions | validation gates, fail-closed |
| receipt integrity | `dipcatcher verify-research` | committed `receipts/` tree | `make receipts-reverify` |
| analytics honesty | `validate_analytics_export` fails closed on `live_pnl_claim=true` | `hedge_lab*.yaml` scope comments | test suite + CI |
| sealed failures kept | blocked receipts stay `valid: true`, `state: "blocked"` | `docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md` | receipt verifier rules |

### Failure-mode catalog

Common ways a run can go wrong, and the gate that refuses it. None of
these fail silently.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Gate that catches it |
|---|---|---|
| run dies before sealing | unsupported data source or non-finite parameter | config-safety validation |
| notebook fails verification | edited or corrupted receipt | `verify-research` hash recompute |
| missing SOTA family rows | catalog drift | versioned 23-family catalog requirement |
| empty panel blob | DGP mixing | panel-or-skip honesty rule |
| NAV divergence vs incumbent | qlib `limit_threshold` fallback | documented semantic differences in parity receipt |
| hindsight leaks in evaluation | vintage cheating | `validation/vintage_eval.py` (VINTAGE-TS) |
| promotion of synthetic evidence | mislabeled source | fail-closed promotion gate |
| readiness endpoint red | missing manifest or invalid receipt | `/ready` fail-closed |
| agent-proposed factor judged by its proposer | referee capture | `validation/agent_referee.py` frozen betting referee |
| import layering drift | boundary violation | `scripts/check_import_boundaries.py` + arch-guards workflow |

### The five live-evidence conditions as a gate diagram

The five conditions from [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness)
as what they actually are: a single AND gate whose output today is

```

## Institutional readiness

Reproduced verbatim from
[`docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md`](docs/INSTITUTIONAL_READINESS.md), which
opens with the same evidence-gating principle repeated throughout this
README:

> Dipcatcher is Artificial Hedge's research lab. This matrix is
> deliberately evidence-gated: a capability is not marked ready because a
> module exists or a synthetic fixture passes.

| Control area | Current state | Evidence / gate |
|---|---|---|
| Point-in-time data contract | Implemented for file adapters; revision-aware on the evaluation side | PIT timestamp validation, duplicate-key checks, OHLCV checks, manifest hash verification, and decision-time filtering for late cross-sectional/market aggregates. Wave 15 adds `validation/vintage_eval.py` (VINTAGE-TS): validity-interval reconstruction, delayed-label filtering, and hindsight-contamination audits over SYNTHETIC revision regimes — the *evaluation* layer now detects vintage cheating even though true as-of vintages on the public tape remain a procurement gap. |
| Configuration safety | Implemented | Unsupported data sources, non-finite simulator parameters, and non-stationary synthetic persistence fail validation |
| Data lineage | Implemented | `dipcatcher doctor` requires source identity, four canonical artifacts, SHA-256s, nonnegative row counts, and data-root containment |
| Research reproducibility | Implemented | Immutable receipt binds Git revision, dirty-worktree hash, config, dataset content, runtime, package versions, and benchmark catalog version |
| SOTA scientific benches | Implemented as research diagnostics on the lab panel | Canonical verifier requires the versioned 23-family catalog; fixture-only toys are `dgp=fixture` and excluded from panel Kupiec H-rows; panel-or-skip (empty blob) fails scorecard honesty rather than silently mixing DGPs |
| Validation integrity | Implemented | Walk-forward, purge/embargo, CPCV audit, HAC/DM, multiple-testing and conformal family gates. Waves 12–16 add the anytime-valid layer: e-BH/e-LORD/e-SAFFRON online FDR, minimax-optimal conformal e-detectors, rank confidence sequences (anytime-valid ranker ordering), replicable conformal (auditable calibration thresholds), and `validation/agent_referee.py` — a frozen post-submission-only betting referee so agent-proposed factors are judged at every stopping time by a procedure the proposer cannot touch. |
| Numerical risk controls | Implemented | Covariance inputs are finite and square; PSD repair is deterministic eigenvalue clipping with finite-output guarantees |
| Execution research | Implemented as simulation | Next-open fills, costs, participation, Almgren–Chriss/TWAP comparisons, and tamper-evident backtest artifacts |
| Paper / shadow operation | Implemented as simulation | Crash-resumable simulated broker; resume appends prior orders/equity/shadow-equity/positions/cash rows and fill receipts; deterministic target/exposure ordering; kill switch, champion/shadow dry-run, no live capital |
| Promotion | Fail-closed | Synthetic evidence, missing metrics, non-finite metrics, and invalid receipts cannot promote |
| CI reproducibility | Implemented | Frozen `uv.lock`, lock consistency check, full tests, type/lint checks, canonical receipt verification |
| CI token scope | Implemented | Workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` is restricted to repository contents read access; no job in CI requires write access |
| Package distribution | Implemented | CI builds wheel and source distribution, installs the wheel without the checkout installed, and runs the installed `dipcatcher --help` entry point |
| API security boundary | Implemented for local/service operation | API-key authentication, loopback fail-closed default, constant-time key comparison, secure response headers, artifact-root containment, 64 KiB streamed request-body cap, and strict request schemas |
| Dependency and code security | Implemented as CI gates | Locked dependency `pip-audit` report, medium/high Bandit gate, and retained machine-readable audit artifact |
| Container operations | CI-gated | Non-root runtime user, loopback default, healthcheck, immutable dependency sync, host-local optional MLflow binding; CI builds the image and waits for its healthcheck |
| Vendor market data | Adapter interface implemented; prospective feed unavailable | A fail-closed licensed-vendor HTTP adapter skeleton checks release and ingest timestamps, but no entitlement or qualifying externally timestamped complete-universe next-open feed is configured. The paired paper prototype fails closed without that evidence; the local retrospective snapshot does not qualify. |
| Live broker connectivity | Not implemented | No live orders, broker credentials, or live P&L claims are supported |
| Live readiness | Blocked by missing external evidence | Requires authorized vendor data, broker adapter, operational controls, and independently verified holdout/forward evidence |

### Dual honesty catalogs

Two different surfaces exist and must never be conflated:

1. **Research scorecard / family blobs** — `FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS`
   rejects `sharpe`/`sortino`/`calmar`/`pnl`/`nav` key tokens in lab
   headlines.
2. **Paper/backtest `analytics_export`** — may nest equity `nav_*` and
   stress `*_pnl` diagnostics under `ANALYTICS_SCHEMA_KEYS`; its honesty
   gate is `live_pnl_claim=false` via `validate_analytics_export`
   (fail-closed on `true`).

`/ready` is fail-closed when `data_manifest` or the immutable research
receipt is missing or invalid. A green readiness response proves data
provenance and research-artifact integrity for the configured research
runtime — nothing more.

### Minimum evidence before any live claim

All five of the following must be present and independently reviewable
before this repository would even consider a live claim — quoted verbatim:

1. A licensed, point-in-time data source with release and ingestion
   timestamps.
2. A broker adapter with authenticated order and fill reconciliation.
3. A non-synthetic holdout and deployment-shaped forward/shadow record.
4. Cost, liquidity, borrow, financing, and failure-mode measurements from
   the target venue.
5. A signed promotion receipt whose immutable verifier passes and whose
   live authorization is explicit.

**None of these five conditions exist in this repository today.** Until
they do, dipcatcher outputs are research, backtest, or simulated
paper/shadow evidence only — see [Read this first](#read-this-first).

## fx-1

`src/fx1` (version `0.4.0`) is code and a training plan for a quant-research
model. The declared base constant, `fx1.BASE_MODEL`, is
`"moonshotai/Kimi-K3"`. **This repository does not contain a fine-tuned
checkpoint**, local generation is unimplemented, and — quoted directly from
[`docs/FX1_TRAINING.md`](docs/FX1_TRAINING.md) — "no training run has been
launched from it."

### Training ladder and pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ladder["Training ladder -- a plan, not a launched run"]
    direction LR
    proxy["PROXY\nsmall open model or\nquantized K3 serving build\n(hundreds of USD/run)"] --> finalk3["FINAL_K3\nLoRA/QLoRA on full K3 base\nrental multi-node cluster\n(five to six figures USD)"]
    finalk3 --> distill["DISTILL\nK3-LoRA teacher distilled into\na smaller servable fx-1 student"]
  end
  subgraph pipeline["Six-stage gated pipeline (fx1.train.pipeline)"]
    direction LR
    data["data"] --> quality["quality"] --> eval_base["eval_base"] --> train["train"] --> eval_candidate["eval_candidate"] --> card["card"]
  end
```

Hardware reality, from the same document: the K3 checkpoint is roughly
1.4 TB in MXFP4 (≈5.6 TB dequantized BF16), serving needs roughly 64
accelerators, and a `FINAL_K3` run needs at least two nodes — enforced in
`TrainConfig`, not just written down. "v0.x never full-fine-tunes."

A stage that cannot produce its evidence stops the pipeline — there are no
skip flags. Highlights: a frozen split manifest and eval-contamination
removal (`fx1.data.quality`); base-model eval results hashed into the run
before training is even allowed to start; immutable training receipts
(git revision, dirty-worktree flag, config/corpus/split/eval hashes, seed,
environment fingerprint) re-checked by `verify_training_receipt`; a
statistical ship gate (`fx1.eval.compare`) requiring a paired-bootstrap
confidence interval on pass-rate deltas plus McNemar's test, where the
domain-improvement interval must exclude zero; generated (never hand-edited)
multi-node ZeRO-3 cluster configs; and a DPO preference stage
(`fx1.train.dpo`) that makes honesty a native behavior rather than a
post-hoc filter.

### What runs today

- `fx1 corpus build` turns receipts into JSONL. Eligible lines keep a
  receipt hash. Ineligible receipts become negative examples. The build
  does **not** train a model. Current seed-corpus status: 5 receipts
  loaded (5 eligible), plus — since v8 — 88 host-local research-run
  manifests (`data/metadata/research/runs/*.json`) yielding 77 positive
  (SYNTHETIC-labeled, simulated-data evidence, never market evidence) and
  11 negative (fail-closed refusal) examples. The lab's research output
  *is* fx-1's training-data flywheel: every new gate-passed receipt grows
  the corpus automatically.
- `fx1 eval` scores a backend on a fixed task bank (honesty, domain,
  general). `make fx1-eval` calls Moonshot's hosted Kimi K3 and needs
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`. That call grades the hosted **base** model, not any
  fine-tuned artifact.
- `fx1 train manifest` writes an immutable run manifest only when a corpus
  and an on-record base-model eval are both present. It does **not**
  launch a training job.
- `LocalFx1Backend` refuses a directory that lacks a model card cleared by
  the ship gate. `complete()` raises `NotImplementedError` until a
  distilled student exists (`src/fx1/serve/backends.py`).
- The **honesty contract inherits across the harness/model boundary by
  construction, not by convention**:
  `fx1.honesty.FORBIDDEN_HEADLINE_TOKENS` mirrors
  `quant_fund.research.catalog.registry.FORBIDDEN_RESEARCH_METRIC_KEYS`
  token-for-token, and
  [`tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py`](tests/fx1/test_honesty_inheritance.py)
  fails the build the moment the two lists disagree.

```bash
uv run fx1 --version
uv run fx1 harness list
uv run fx1 corpus build --receipts-dir receipts --out data/fx1/corpus.jsonl
```

`data/fx1/` is gitignored. The ladder, ship gate, and hardware notes are in
[`docs/FX1.md`](docs/FX1.md) and [`docs/FX1_TRAINING.md`](docs/FX1_TRAINING.md).
They describe the plan. They are **not** a record of a completed training
run. Versioning follows its own semantic-versioning contract — see
[`docs/FX1_API_STABILITY.md`](docs/FX1_API_STABILITY.md) — with
`fx1.__version__` as the canonical source that `pyproject.toml` reads via a
Hatch dynamic-version hook.

The base model, `moonshotai/Kimi-K3`, is Moonshot AI's own weights under
Moonshot's own license; nothing in this repository, including its
proprietary [LICENSE](#license), extends any right to those weights. See
[Acknowledgements and third-party notices](#acknowledgements-and-third-party-notices).

## Web explorer and tooling

[`web/`](web/) (102 tracked files) is a read-only, fully static TypeScript
app (React + Vite) for browsing the lab's committed research evidence:
strategy stat blobs, simulated equity curves and drawdowns, per-segment
("regime") stats, and the sealed receipts' verification-relevant fields.
There is **no backend** — `dist/` can be served from any static host, and
`web/scripts/export_fixtures.py` regenerates its committed JSON fixtures
from `receipts/*.json` and the committed carry-equity parquets verbatim.

| Surface | Source (committed, read-only) |
|---|---|
| Strategy list + per-segment stats | `artifacts/carry_champion*.json`, `receipts/legacy-unsealed/adaptive_mix_*.json` |
| Equity + drawdown charts | `artifacts/carry_equity*.parquet` → `fixtures/equity/*.json` |
| Receipt list + verification panel | `receipts/*.json` copied verbatim → `fixtures/receipts/` |
| Digest resolution | Export-time scan mapping embedded `sha256` fields to committed files |

Its honesty posture matches everything else in this document: it renders
fields **as stored**, labels everything `research_only` / simulated, never
asserts a performance claim, and does not re-run verification — the
authoritative, fail-closed check is always `dipcatcher verify-research`.
Its "client-side checks" panel is informational only.

```bash
cd web
npm ci                 # locked deps; node >= 20
npm run dev            # vite dev server
npm run build          # tsc --noEmit + vite build -> dist/ (static)
npm run preview        # serve dist/ locally
```

A generated TypeScript client for the FastAPI service lives separately in
[`clients/typescript`](clients/typescript) (`openapi.json`, `client.ts`,
`schema.d.ts`) and is unrelated to the receipt-browser above.

## API and security

The FastAPI service (`dipcatcher api`, default host `127.0.0.1`):

- Config paths are allowlisted to the repository's `configs/` directory —
  the containment check resolves `_CONFIGS_DIR` before any comparison.
- If `QUANT_API_KEY` is set, non-public routes require header `X-API-Key`,
  compared in **constant time**; if unset, only loopback clients are
  accepted.
- Docker binds `127.0.0.1` by default; to listen on `0.0.0.0`, set
  `QUANT_API_KEY` and override the host explicitly.
- Request bodies are capped at a streamed **64 KiB**, and request schemas
  are strict.
- `POST /backtest` is deliberately bounded to 30 causal decision dates and
  at most 31 bar dates; run larger studies through the CLI instead.
- `/ready` is fail-closed when `data_manifest` or the immutable research
  receipt is missing or invalid (see
  [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness)).
- Responses carry secure headers; the container runs as a non-root user
  with a healthcheck, and CI builds the image and waits on that
  healthcheck before passing.

Beyond the API surface, repository-wide security posture is CI-gated, not
aspirational: a locked-dependency `pip-audit` report (`make audit`), a
medium/high [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) static-analysis gate
(`make security`), [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) on every push and
pull request, [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) on a
weekly schedule and on branch-protection-rule changes, and a dedicated
secret-scanning workflow (`secret-scan.yml`) on every push and pull
request. See [Security policy](#security-policy) for how to report a
vulnerability.

## Testing, CI, and supply chain

### Test suite

```bash
make lint
make typecheck
make test
make fx1-gate
```

`make test` is the lab suite's PR gate (`tests/unit`, `tests/property`,
`tests/regression`, `tests/end_to_end`; not network, not slow; run under
`pytest-xdist`). `make test-full` adds the slow lane. The fx-1 suite is
separate: `make fx1-test`. `tests/fx1` is deliberately excluded from the
default pytest testpaths so the two suites never silently merge.

**1,168** tracked `test_*.py` files across nine lanes:

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Test files by lane (1,168 total)
    "unit" : 1071
    "property" : 38
    "fx1" : 31
    "regression" : 17
    "formal" : 4
    "perf" : 3
    "end_to_end" : 2
    "native" : 1
    "examples" : 1
```

`tests/unit` alone (1,071 files) outnumbers every file in `src/` (893).
`tests/property` (38 files) runs [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/)-based
property tests, with an extended nightly lane
(`property-nightly.yml`) beyond the PR-sized `adversarial-properties.yml`.
`tests/formal` (4 files) backs the TLA+ / Z3 formal-verification gate
(`make formal`). Coverage is gated at **81%** in `pyproject.toml`
(`fail_under = 81`); this repository does not publish coverage to a hosted
service, so the number you can trust is the CI floor itself, not a
third-party badge.

### Continuous integration

**19** workflow files under [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/).
CI runs the PR-gate test matrix on Python **3.12 and 3.13**; the separate
`matrix.yml` extends that to **3.14** and to macOS/Windows runners on a
schedule and on `workflow_dispatch`.

**19** workflow files under [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/).

### Supply chain

- **Locked dependencies.** `uv.lock` is authoritative; CI and `make sync`
  both run `uv sync --frozen`, so an unresolved or drifted lock file fails
  the build rather than silently re-resolving.
- **Vulnerability scanning.** `make audit` runs `pip-audit` against the
  locked dependency set; `make security` runs Bandit at the medium/high
  gate.
- **Static analysis.** CodeQL runs on every push and pull request, plus a
  schedule.
- **Supply-chain scorecard.** [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/)
  runs weekly and on branch-protection-rule changes.
- **SBOM.** `fx1 sbom` generates a hash-pinned software bill of materials
  from the locked dependency set.
- **Package build smoke.** CI builds both the wheel and the source
  distribution, installs the wheel **without** the checkout present, and
  runs the installed `dipcatcher --help` entry point — the same check this
  README's own packaging changes were validated against (see
  [Governance and ownership](#governance-and-ownership)).
- **Attestation ladder.** `fx1 sign` and `fx1 attestation` implement a
  tiered release-signing scheme for model checkpoints.

## Documentation index

[`docs/`](docs/) holds **182** tracked files, **111** of them top-level
`.md` documents. The table below links **104** of them — every top-level
doc except seven that headline a forbidden metric (Sharpe, Sortino,
Calmar, P&L, or NAV-as-return) in their own title or body, mirroring the
`exclude_docs` list that `mkdocs.yml` itself already applies to the built
documentation site. They are not deleted, hidden, or hard to find — they
are simply not indexed here, for the same reason this README does not
headline those metrics. The seven are named in the footnote below the
table.

| Doc | Doc | Doc |

## Repository health

This repository scores itself, in public, with a rules-based
[`HONESTY_RATING.md`](HONESTY_RATING.md) that explicitly caps
self-reported metrics, zeroes out claims without committed evidence, and
penalizes a red main branch. It is a **self-assessment**, not a
third-party audit — read it as such. Its most recent scored snapshot
(subject commit `0e05f653`, 2026-09-29, one commit before this README's
own base) reads:

```text
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

> "759/1000 places dipcatcher in the top few percent of solo-maintained
> quant repos on *engineering integrity*... The score is held back not by
> what the repo claims, but by what it hasn't done: ship a release, merge
> its own queue, license itself, and exist as a model." — `HONESTY_RATING.md`

That snapshot scored **Licensing & legal at 5 / 15**, docked specifically
for **"No LICENSE file. For a repo this engineered, the single cheapest
legal artifact is missing."** This repository now has one — see
[License](#license) — which was the top-priority, cheapest fix the
engine's own scoring identified. This README, expanded from a 232-line
overview into the document you are reading, is a direct response to the
same audit's Documentation factor (82/100) and its explicit call-out of
drift and bloat risk. Neither change moves the *other* docked items —
zero tags, an open PR queue, no fine-tuned fx-1 checkpoint — those remain
exactly as scored, and this README does not claim otherwise.

## Governance and ownership

Dipcatcher and fx-1 are a single-owner project. Every file in this
repository — code, documentation, receipts, configuration, and this README
itself — is authored for and owned by **Advaith Vaithianathan, founder of
Artificial Hedge**, as stated in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) and
[`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff), and as declared formally in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE). Three separate internal documents
([`docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md`](docs/RESEARCH_CENTRE.md),
[`docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md),
[`docs/SOTA_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`](docs/SOTA_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)) independently
describe this repository the same way:

> "Dipcatcher is Artificial Hedge's **proprietary research lab**. It
> measures forecast quality with proper scoring rules. It does not exist
> to manufacture Sharpe ratios."

There is no open-source contribution model here, no CLA, and no shared
maintainership. This section exists to say plainly, in one place, what
[License](#license) says formally.

## Contributing

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers local setup, the PR gate
commands, and style conventions for anyone **explicitly authorized in
writing** by the Owner to work in this repository. It now opens with an
explicit statement of the repository's proprietary status. Unsolicited
pull requests from the public are not the intended contribution path for
a single-owner proprietary codebase; if you believe you have found a bug
or a security issue, see [Security policy](#security-policy) instead.

## Security policy

Report vulnerabilities privately through a
[GitHub private security advisory](https://github.com/artificial-hedge/dipcatcher/security/advisories/new) —
never in a public issue, PR, or discussion. [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
has the full scope, hard rules (fail-closed defaults, no credentials in
source, opt-in network access, no broker connectivity), a 72-hour
acknowledgment / 7-day status-update / 90-day disclosure target, a safe
harbor for good-faith research, and the supply-chain controls summarized
in [Testing, CI, and supply chain](#testing-ci-and-supply-chain).

Reference material that would interrupt the narrative above: an FAQ, a
glossary, environment variables, complete file censuses, a make-target
atlas, and a terminal cheat-sheet.

### FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this a trading bot?</strong></summary>

No. It is receipt-bound quant research and simulated paper trading. There
is no broker connectivity anywhere in the tree; setting
`runtime.allow_live: true` raises by construction. See
[Read this first](#read-this-first).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I fork or copy it?</strong></summary>

No. The repository is proprietary and all rights reserved; visibility is
not a license. See [License](#license).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are there no Sharpe ratios in the research headlines?</strong></summary>

Because a Sharpe ratio measures a trading outcome, and this repository has
no trading outcomes — only proper scores on labeled data. The forbidden
keys are enforced in code and mirrored across the harness/model boundary;
see [Honesty enforcement map](#honesty-enforcement-map).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are the fx-1 model weights?</strong></summary>

Nowhere in this tree. No training run has been launched from this
repository; `LocalFx1Backend.complete()` raises `NotImplementedError`
until a distilled student exists. See [fx-1](#fx-1).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do the tests outnumber the source files?</strong></summary>

1,277 tracked test files against 900 source files at `e00ab310c`. The
repository's premise is that claims are only as good as their weakest
verification, so verification is the largest single area of the tree.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if I run a config marked SYNTHETIC and present it as real?</strong></summary>

The code fights you: the CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`, the notebook
records `data_source: synthetic`, SYNTHETIC-as-live fails the promotion
gate in `quant_fund.validation.gates`, and the CI smoke test fails if the
notebook says anything else.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What exactly is a receipt?</strong></summary>

A JSON artifact whose seal field is the SHA-256 of its other fields,
binding git revision, inputs, code path, and scores. See
[Anatomy of a sealed receipt](#anatomy-of-a-sealed-receipt).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What counts as evidence here?</strong></summary>

Committed, hash-sealed, re-verifiable artifacts — never screenshots, prose
claims, or deleted failures. Failed candidates stay sealed as reviewable
failures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are negative results committed?</strong></summary>

So that a failed candidate cannot be silently rerun until it looks better.
Two published examples are linked in
[Published negative results](#published-negative-results).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use my own data?</strong></summary>

Public collection is opt-in via `dipcatcher collect` and needs a network.
A licensed point-in-time vendor feed is one of the five missing
live-evidence conditions; the adapter skeleton fails closed without an
entitlement.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does the web explorer verify receipts?</strong></summary>

No. It renders committed fields as stored, labels everything
`research_only`/simulated, and never re-runs verification — the
authoritative check is always `dipcatcher verify-research`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the difference between the harness and fx-1?</strong></summary>

`src/quant_fund` is the lab: data engine, evaluation, verification.
`src/fx1` is the model lane: corpus, eval, and training manifests for a
planned fine-tune of `moonshotai/Kimi-K3`. Receipts flow from the first
into the second as training data.

</details>

## Final disclaimer

Everything in this document describes **research software**: point-in-time
data discipline, proper scoring rules, sealed and re-verifiable evidence,
and an honesty contract enforced in code and in CI — not a trading
product, not a licensed offering, and not a track record. Every
performance-shaped number above is either a **correctness check** (the
qlib parity NAV comparison) or a **proper score on labeled data**
(pinball, CRPS, PIT, Brier, ECE), never a forbidden headline metric.
SYNTHETIC-labeled results are correctness tests on generated data, always
labeled as such, never market evidence. There is no broker connectivity,
no order-placement path, and no live-trading claim anywhere in this
repository — see [Institutional readiness](#institutional-readiness) for
the five concrete conditions that would have to exist before that
changed, none of which exist today. This repository, in full, is the
proprietary property of Advaith Vaithianathan / Artificial Hedge under
the [License](#license) above: **no forking, copying, or reuse without
prior written permission.**
