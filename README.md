**dipcatcher** is receipt-bound quant research on US equities and crypto for a
small Alpaca account. Research and simulated paper only.

The dip question, in `fx1.bench.dip` and
`receipts/dip_bench_crypto_1d_20260925.json`, is the probability that a
drawdown recovers within 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. That committed receipt scores
an in-sample climatology baseline on 11 historical crypto series. Disclaimer
from the file:

> Research/backtest evidence on historical data, not live performance. The climatology forecaster is an in-sample descriptive baseline; it is not a tradeable signal and authorizes nothing.

US names use the NYSE and NASDAQ common-stock universe, with public daily and
minute bars available through opt-in collectors (Stooq, and the Hugging Face
OHLCV-1m adapter). Crypto research uses public Binance series. Alpaca is an
offline quote-column preset for book panels. Fills in this tree go through
`SimulatedBroker`.

The Python distribution name is `fx-1`. Console scripts are `dipcatcher` and
`fx1`. Version `0.4.0` lives in `fx1.__version__`.

The coverage badge is the CI floor in `pyproject.toml` (`fail_under = 80`).
This repository does not publish coverage to a hosted service. CI runs on
Python 3.12 and 3.13; Ruff and mypy run in the lint job.

## What you have in this checkout

| Surface | What it is |
|---|---|
| `configs/research.yaml`, `configs/paper.yaml` | `data.source: synthetic`. The CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`. These runs are labeled correctness tests. |
| `receipts/` | Committed research artifacts. Each file sets `research_only: true` and carries its own disclaimer. |
| `src/quant_fund` | The research pipeline: point-in-time data, forecasts, fusion, a constrained optimizer, a risk gate, and simulated paper. |
| `src/fx1` | Corpus, eval, and training-manifest code at `0.4.0`. No model weights are in the tree. |
| Live orders | Refused. Setting `runtime.allow_live: true` raises `allow_live is unsupported: no live broker adapter in this repository`. |

Research scores that the lab will headline are proper scores: pinball, CRPS,
PIT, QLIKE, Brier, ECE, Kupiec, and HMM likelihood.

## What makes it different

- **Sealed receipts.** Phase-1 benchmark and tournament files carry
  `receipt_sha256`, the SHA-256 of the other fields.
  `dipcatcher verify-research` recomputes it and exits nonzero on a mismatch
  (`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`). Paper promotion receipts use the same
  seal. Files under `receipts/` record the input and script hashes the result
  claims (`inputs_sha256`, `script_sha256`, `bar_files_sha256`, and related
  fields).
- **Fail-closed verification.** An invalid notebook, a missing metric, or a
  non-finite metric does not promote. SYNTHETIC evidence marked as live fails
  the gate in `quant_fund.validation.gates`. `dipcatcher doctor` exits nonzero
  until a data manifest and a valid research receipt are both present.
- **Published negative results.**
  `receipts/adaptive_mix_band_search_20asset_1d_20260922.json` records
  `selected_band: null` and `eligible: false` on every candidate.
  `receipts/basis_pair_candidate_20asset_1d_20260922.json` records
  `development_eligible: false`. A sealed blocked tournament stays a
  reviewable failure (`valid: true`, `state: "blocked"`) with no test receipt
  and no selected candidate (`docs/RECEIPT_VERIFICATION.md`).
- **qlib parity receipt.** `receipts/incumbent_bench_qlib.json` is one matched
  workload against qlib 0.9.7 on Binance daily bars (`BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`,
  `SOLUSDT`), with `research_only: true` and `live_pnl_claim: false`. Copied
  from that file, `nav_max_rel_diff` is `1.0290734772388363e-07`. Disclaimer,
  copied verbatim: "Single matched workload vs qlib 0.9.x on real Binance
  daily bars. Correctness is NAV parity; latency is single-process wall time.
  Not a claim of superiority across all product dimensions."
- **Synthetic stays labeled.** Default research and paper configs set
  `data.source: synthetic`. The CLI prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC` and the
  word `SYNTHETIC`. The CI smoke fails if that notebook's `data_source` is
  anything else.

## Architecture

Derived from [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Dipcatcher
estimates a market state at a point-in-time decision clock, then allocates
under constraints and costs. The optimizer consumes that state. A forecast
does not bypass the risk gate.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  raw["Raw market data"] --> pit["Point-in-time data layer"]
  pit --> feat["Feature engine and label engine"]
  feat --> state["Market-state forecasts"]
  state --> cal["Forecast calibration"]
  cal --> fusion["Forecast fusion"]
  fusion --> opt["Constrained portfolio optimizer"]
  opt --> risk["Pre-trade risk engine"]
  risk --> plan["Execution planner"]
  plan --> sim["Research, backtest, paper, or shadow"]
  sim --> mon["Attribution, monitoring, sealed receipts"]
  mon --> verify["dipcatcher verify-research"]
```

The market state at decision time holds expected return, features, alpha,
residual, volatility, covariance, regime probabilities, tail, liquidity, and
uncertainty. Features used at time t must have `available_time` at or before
t. The default fill for a close signal on day t is the next available open.
`robinhood+` is a K-line challenger whose default `blend_weight` is 0 until
it beats ridge on a causal synthetic card. The architecture document also
names a live runtime mode; config load rejects it, as the table above says.

## Quick start

Python 3.12 or 3.13, and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). From a clone:

```bash
make sync
uv run dipcatcher research --config configs/research.yaml
uv run dipcatcher verify-research
uv run dipcatcher doctor --config configs/research.yaml
```

`configs/research.yaml` is synthetic. `research` builds that panel, writes a
notebook under `data/metadata/research/`, and prints `DATA_LABEL=SYNTHETIC`.
`verify-research` checks `data/metadata/research/latest.json` and exits
nonzero when the notebook is invalid. `doctor` exits 0 only after the data
manifest and that receipt both check out; on a fresh tree, before `research`,
it exits 1.

Simulated paper, also synthetic, capped the way CI caps it:

```bash
uv run dipcatcher paper --config configs/paper.yaml --max-steps 2
```

Public collection is opt-in and is separate from ingest. It needs a network.

## Tests

```bash
make lint
make typecheck
make test
make fx1-gate
```

`make test` is the lab suite (`tests/unit`, `tests/property`,
`tests/regression`, `tests/end_to_end`). The fx-1 suite is `make fx1-test`.

## fx-1

`src/fx1` (version `0.4.0`) is code and a training plan for a quant-research
model. The declared base constant is `moonshotai/Kimi-K3`. This repository
does not contain a fine-tuned checkpoint, and local generation is
unimplemented.

What runs today:

- `fx1 corpus build` turns receipts into JSONL. Eligible lines keep a receipt
  hash. Ineligible receipts become negative examples. The build does not
  train a model.
- `fx1 eval` scores a backend on a fixed task bank (honesty, domain,
  general). `make fx1-eval` calls Moonshot's hosted Kimi K3 and needs
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`. That call grades the hosted base model.
- `fx1 train manifest` writes an immutable run manifest only when a corpus
  and an on-record base-model eval are both present. It does not launch a
  training job.
- `LocalFx1Backend` refuses a directory that lacks a model card cleared by
  the ship gate. `complete()` raises `NotImplementedError` until a distilled
  student exists (`src/fx1/serve/backends.py`).

```bash
uv run fx1 --version
uv run fx1 harness list
uv run fx1 corpus build --receipts-dir receipts --out data/fx1/corpus.jsonl
```

`data/fx1/` is gitignored. The ladder, ship gate, and hardware notes are in
`docs/FX1.md` and `docs/FX1_TRAINING.md`. They describe the plan. They are
not a record of a completed training run.

## API security

The FastAPI service (`dipcatcher api`, default host `127.0.0.1`):

- Config paths are allowlisted to the repo `configs/` directory.
- If `QUANT_API_KEY` is set, non-public routes require header `X-API-Key`;
  if unset, only loopback clients are accepted.
- Docker binds `127.0.0.1` by default; to listen on `0.0.0.0`, set
  `QUANT_API_KEY` and override the host.
- `POST /backtest` is deliberately bounded to 30 causal decision dates and at
  most 31 bar dates; run larger studies through the CLI.
