"""Cross-process append correctness for the audit ledger.

The ledger is the root of the evidence chain: several processes appending to
one root must serialize through the ``.lock`` file so the hash chain stays
intact. These tests run real child processes (spawn-safe: module-level
worker, picklable arguments) rather than threads, because flock semantics
across processes are the property under test.
